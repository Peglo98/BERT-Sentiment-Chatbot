I really like the fragrance, too.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I was very disappointed when I got this facial scrub. I had assumed it was like other scrubs I use but it wasn't. This is a powder which you need to mix with water to make a paste before you put it on your face. I have a tendency to like to use scrubs in the shower with me, so this extra step doesn't really work for me. As far as the scrubbing factor goes, it's ok. I didn't feel a real smoothing or softening of my skin after use the way I have with others. The biggest plus is the fragrance (i love the smell of oranges). I won't be repurchasing.", "label": 1}

I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Front and sides were ok, but I couldn't maneuver the back to get it straight. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I did, however, use the shampoo and conditioner (and I still am). I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments. I will resume my regular treatments at my salon.", "label": 1}

It actually is an entire skin care regimine containing a cleanser, a toner, a facial cream, an eye cream and overall moisurizers.

Fragrance is light and smells almost apple-like (but very light). I particularly like the cleanser and the toner.

I have been 'using' this for almost three weeks and I am not happy with it. First, it's almost impossible for me to keep it in place under my eyes. They come wet out of the packet and I was unsure what side was supposed to be placed on my skin. They do not stay in place and I found them falling off easily. Of course, maybe it was me or my skin, so please don't just rely on my review (read others). I will not be reordering.", "label": 1}

{"text": "To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.", "label": 1}
{"text": "At first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!", "label": 1}

I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare  makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!", "label": 1}

I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.", "label": 1}

And all of that would be one thing - but the worst is that the hair completely fell out!  I had hand fulls of hair strands just trying to put the halo on!

Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes.

I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me.

{"text": "I am in my early fifties. I found a multi-step skincare routine a few years ago and I follow it pretty regularly. The final step for both the morning and evening is face oil. For the longest time, I skipped that step because I didn't want my face feeling oily. Plus, it just seemed that it would clog pores and lead to acne. I recently tried a different face oil and found it wasn't a bad step at all. This oil has a nice, essential oil smell to it. The only ingredient that I can detect by smell is the lavender. It's not overpowering, but it is noticeable. The oil absorbs quicker when it's applied to dry skin. I tried it out on the back of my hand and it absorbed nearly right away. When used as the final step in my skincare routine, it took much longer to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling really soft! I haven't had any problems since using it. I personally only use it at nighttime because I don't want my skin looking oily, even for a little while, during the day.", "label": 1}

I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one. My old one has to be adjusted every time I put it on. This one seems to be just fine.", "label": 1}

It has a light, barely noticeable citrus smell to it. It absorbs really quickly but in doing so, I found it to be over drying on my mature skin.

The microbeads have to be crushed or else you have little white beads on your face. It's not difficult to break the beads. I just press on them and they rub into the skin. After applying the serum, my face was really dry. I have been using this at night. I have a multi-step skin care routine so I followed this with my nighttime moisturizer, then retinol, and some face oil. The serum doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. There is a mild scent, but nothing that I could recognize. Overall, it's okay. I haven't noticed any tightening or improvements in my skin.

The metal piece that holds it in never felt really sturdy and when it broke, I wasn't really surprised. This one is the nicest one I've tried. It's a great quality and very sturdy. The size is perfect. The directions say to chill it in the refrigerator, but I have found that it's usually cold enough just leaving it out on my bathroom counter. I use it primarily to help my serums and creams absorb into my skin better. This comes with another tool, a Gua Sha, which I was unfamiliar with.

{"text": "My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop. So now she can easily identify the right bottle without having to open each one.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I love coffee scrubs. This one is a new favorite. There are two types of body scrubs. Dry ones that are like sand and don't clump together or ones that have a lot of oil that cause it to clump together. This one is a dry one. It comes with a little scoop which is nice. My last dry coffee scrub that I had did not, so it actually was a bit messy to use. The directions say to scrub it on your skin and leave for a few seconds before rinsing. Most coffee scrubs that I have tried say to leave it on for a few minutes which I find to be nearly impossible unless you turn the water off. The smell is amazing - a rich coffee scent that is perfect for slow moving mornings. It does leave behind an ever so slightly oily texture, but it goes away after toweling off and leaves behind soft skin. I haven't noticed any difference in my cellulite, but I have read that caffeine helps with it. I don't use it for the cellulite. I like to use it for exfoliating my skin.", "label": 1}

Because I have been using products to work on wrinkles and younger looking skin regularly for the past few years, it's difficult to see new results. This eye cream is a nice creamy consistency. I don't notice any smell from it at all. I am able to apply this to the eye area of both of my eyes with just one dispense from the pump. It absorbs nicely into my skin and keeps my delicate eye skin well hydrated. One thing that I especially like is that it doesn't sting my eyes! I have ultra sensitive eyes and if I sweat, make up and skin care products will often get rubbed into my eyes. Some products cause them to sting or burn. We're having a hot summer here in Georgia and even with sweating, I have not had any issues with it stinging or burning.

{"text": "This is the 3rd peel foot mask that I have tried. The others have been unsuccessful. Still wanting to experience the foot peel, I tried again. The first thing that makes this foot peel better than the others is the foot slippers. The slippers are actually a medium thickness plastic. They remind me of the \u201crubber pants\u201d that my little boy wore over his training underwear when he was 2 years old. These slippers also fit the best of the three that I have tried. I had problems with using the tape, but because my feet are on the larger end, they stayed in place well without it. I wear a size 10 W shoe and these fit my feet fine. They were not too tight nor did I have to stretch them to get them on. They were a little confusing to figure out. The directions said to \u201ccut on the dotted line\u201d but I couldn\u2019t see any dotted line. The 2 slippers were attached together at the top. So I cut them apart and then I had to snip a little off the top to open up where my foot was to go inside. This foot peel has a somewhat pleasant scent. I was worried because one of the ingredients is vinegar and another is fermented milk. Those did not sound appealing at all. However, what I smelled was a combination of the ginger and the chamomile. The hardest thing about this whole process was carving out the time to do it. You have to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes before hand. Then you have to wear the foot booties for 70-90 minutes. Then soak for another 15 minutes afterwards. I\u2019m a busy mom, so it\u2019s hard to find that much free time. I've just started noticing some peeling, so already it's looking more successful than the other ones that I've tried.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

{"text": "My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing.

First of all, I would say it's more of a gel than a cream. It's a tan color and is easy to rub into the skin. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or residue. It also doesn't have much of a scent either. So far I *think* I might be seeing a little fading of my burn scars, but it's not very obvious. However, I am noticing that my freckles and age spots on the back of my hand are looking less noticeable and that's a welcome result.

Prior to ordering this organizer, I had all of my lipsticks & lip glosses shoved in a small drawer.

The organizer is only 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space. The acrylic is sturdy & solid and is easy to clean. Recently I have been looking at acrylic organizers recently in my local stores and they seem to be over priced! This one is bargain!! My teenage daughter tried to claim this one from me, but since it is such a reasonable price, I will probably just go ahead & order her one, too.<br /><br />****Update - I ended up ordering another style of the Marrywindix acrylic organizer for my daughter.

{"text": "I am in my late 40's and always looking for new skin care products to help reduce the signs of aging, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this serum at a discounted price in order to try it out, I was more than happy to do so. It is the first face serum that I have tried that has absolutely no scent or fragrance. It's a very thin consistency, like water. It took a couple of uses to figure out that I can't just pump a little bit on to my finger because it just rolls off. The absorption rate is pretty quick which I like. It's frustrating when you have to wait a few minutes for a serum to absorb into you skin so you can continue your skin care routine. I'm a busy mom & don't have a lot of time to just wait around!  I love the list of natural ingredients!!! I've only been using this for a couple of weeks. I'm not seeing any major improvements with my wrinkles and such, but I am noticing an overall improvement in the texture of my skin.

{"text": "I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly. When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose. I don't use ear plugs very often, but it's nice to have them handy when I do need them, so I don't have to fumble around my night stand looking for them.", "label": 1}

The pump lid is easy to use & dispenses a nice amount of oil. One pump is enough for my scar. When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears. It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me. I've been keeping it on my nightstand and applying it at bedtime. If it left my hands feeling sticky or greasy, I would have to get up & wash them. There is a very light, natural scent - it kind of reminds me of a mild olive oil. It's only noticeable when I hold my arm right under my nose. My scar is beginning to diminish. It's still there, but it has faded a little bit. I'm excited to see what happens after more use!

A nice feature is that the color on the brush head bristles fades to let you know that the brush head is worn out and needs replacing.<br /><br />The electric flosser works really well--maybe not quite as well as string floss, but it\u2019s definitely better than poking into gaps between teeth with a toothpick on a handle.  The flosser is good for cleaning under my bridge, which needs to be kept really clean to prevent gum irritation and swelling.", "label": 1}

It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike.

Also, I tried several of these types of brushes and this one is not as easy to clean as the others. The way this is supposed to work is to retract the bristles with the button and the hair that remains on top can be slid off. Since the tines do not retract fully on the top part of the brush, the hair does not slide off easily. Instead, I have to pick it off.<br /><br />Note that this is for long-haired pets only; I would not use this with a pet with short hair. I have three long-haired cats and even though this works some, I am not impressed for the two reasons I mentioned above.

Since these are of medium density, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy. I also love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These would have been perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer because each comes in their own package EXCEPT for the negative issue I mention below.<br /><br />There is one big negative, however. Each package is marked with a price of $1.55 each. Unfortunately, at the current price of $9.95, it comes to $1.99 per sponge which is $.44 cents more than the price marked.

{"text": "These bandages have many uses. There are 16 black rolls that are individually wrapped and each roll is 5 yards apiece and 2 inches tall. These self-adhere as the bandage is wrapped around a hand, leg, arm, etc. These stick well. The stretch allows this to be used like kinesiology tape with the exception that one cannot shower with this successfully and each wrap is for one-time use.<br /><br />The entire roll does not have to be used at once as it depends on the amount needed. When used where joints open and close, such as a knee or elbow, the wrap may bunch up in the crease as expected. However, this is perfect to use as a lightweight version of a carpal tunnel brace by wrapping it around a bad wrist, hand, and thumb. It does not stick to my skin nor to a pet's fur, which is wonderful.<br /><br />This is versatile enough to wrap around the handle of a tennis racquet to get a good grip or an umbrella or cane handle. There are just so many useful possibilities besides medical reasons.<br /><br />In summary, because the wraps are two inches wide and are not designed to stick to the skin, it does have a tendency to bunch up if wrapped around a knee or elbow, so it is not perfect for everything. I feel these are great bandages to have in one's medicine cabinet. At the current price of $15.19 ($15.99 minus 5%) it comes to $.95 cents per roll which is on the high side of competitively priced. These are self-adhesive bandages rebranded as tattoo grip tape.", "label": 1}

The round ends are good for blending or any large make-up application.<br /><br />This feels good to hold, blends well, and feels soft against my skin.  Also, the sponge does not smell.<br /><br />In summary, this blender makes a great gift for the make-up obsessed. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. The current price of $7.50 is on the pricey side. I tried other blenders of this quality that sell for less than half this price when purchased in a pack of three or more. For instance this [[ASIN:B08QCJ3DF7 set]] currently sells for $2.50 per sponge as there are 4 sponges for $9.99.

In total there are five items. The bath bombs spell MOM with the heart substituting for the letter O.<br /><br />The outside packaging looks giftable but the inside is just an ordinary uninspiring throw-away box. The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel. That is not always the case with bath bombs today.<br /><br />The current price of $9.74 ($12.99 minus 25%) comes to $1.95 per item which is reasonable.", "label": 1}

Note that I ordered the style called \"Silver 1.\" However, what is pictured is a lot longer than what I received. Mine is more tightly compacted and half the size and there were no wires I could stretch out.

Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet.

However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product.\u00a0<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the wand bends too easily. I would have preferred if the arm was a bit stiffer to make it easier to work with and allow me to apply more pressure.<br /><br />Overall, this set is excellent and about 7 inches long.

It also comes with a great metal sponge holder,\u00a0a silicone brush cleaner, and some cleaning solution. The sponges are light\u00a0and airy like most sponges like this on the market.\u00a0<br /><br />The burgundy sponge with the flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (teal) and the hour-glass (pink) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.<br /><br />These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />I personally do not use a silicone sponge cleaner. I prefer to use my hands and soap and water but having the silicone cleaner with cleaning solution provided is a nice touch.<br /><br />The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too--at least to me.\u00a0<br /><br />The current price of $7.99 is a great deal for this.", "label": 1}

Of course, when applying one of these, it is important to turn it so the tail goes down. That can sometimes be tricky.<br /><br />The only negative I see is that the seam shows the stitching as can be seen in my photo. They should have covered this with the area that is tied (meaning the area where the tail flows down).

To turn the unit on or off, I just held down the power button for three seconds. To go to the next temperature, I just pressed the on/off button quickly. This flat iron heats rapidly. The temperature selections available go from 300 to 450. I used it at 350 degrees to straighten my hair and I was able to do this relatively quickly as I have short curly hair. Also, there was no frizz after I was done.\u00a0<br /><br />The clips provided are strange looking as can be seen from the photo.

Since the combs are separated, this brush can act as a vent brush for blow drying even though it is not of circular design.

I removed plastic seal on the top of both bottles and turned as specified on the bottle. I spent 10 minutes trying to open the shampoo.

{"text": "This is a nice set of combs--one wide-tooth and one sort of fine-tooth with two regularly-spaced ones. I know others mentioned that they found the combs to be sharp on the edges when combing. The one wide-tooth comb has blunted tines but the other three have pointed tines. However, those pointed tine ones were not sharp on my scalp. I have short to medium fine curly hair and these passed through my hair easily (wet or dry) and I did not feel scratched. I actually like the points massaging my scalp because on the combs I received, they were not super sharp.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot tell if this set is wooden as it claims. It is possible they are wooden but because they are highly polished, they feel and look like plastic. I attend craft shows and it is possible to get a plastic feel and look to wood, so unless I broke one of the combs in half (which I am unwilling to do), I cannot tell. I still think the current price of $9.99 is reasonable even they are plastic.", "label": 1}
{"text": "These headbands remind of Woodstock and the 60's. They are headbands the flower children would wear. The colors are muted but are perfect for casual wear. The black bands (one beaded and one not) are suitable for both business and casual attire.<br /><br />These are about two inches wide and do feel relatively comfortable on. Note that the beaded bands are a bit bouffanty due to the thickness of the cloth with the extra height of the beads. Unfortunately, these are not my style. If one is in the market for this type of accessory, they are fully functional with a little bit of statement. The cloth is wrapped securely around the outer edge of the band and appears they will last a while. The current price of $16.99 is reasonable for this set.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]].  I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I purchased these type sponges before and I find them great to work with. I like to use the flat end to blend and the pointed end to highlight around the eyes or cheeks. I do find liquid foundation sink in a bit so I use these mostly with creams and some powders.

The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these.

There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I am sorry I ordered this bag and am very disappointed. It's cheap, flimsy, and holds light items. Items have a tendency of tilting outward in the pockets depending on the size of the item and are at risk of falling out. The detachable clear plastic tote at the bottom is a nice touch, but that is about it. The zippers are sticky.<br /><br />In my opinion this cosmetic / travel organizer will not last at all. My biggest complaint is the hook for hanging. It is not a full-size hanger hook so there are a limited number of places to hang this. It can be hung on a wire shelf with holes (like a shower caddy or closet with wire inserts) but it does not hang on a shower rod or on a closet rod or any rod much thicker than a finger.<br /><br />This cosmetic bag is not even worth consideration in my opinion.", "label": 0}

{"text": "After moistening my face and the brush heads with water, I tested the sensitive and normal heads with both soap and [[ASIN:B01648QDS4 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Cream Cleanser, 5 Fluid Ounce]] and the massaging head with water alone. After a one-minute &#34;application&#34; with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.<br /><br />The packages includes:<br /><br />- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying<br />- one charging base with power cord<br />- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels<br />- one white plastic zippered travel case<br />- one instruction pamphlet<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a &#34;cool&#34; factor to it.<br /><br />- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a &#34;tripacer&#34; (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.<br /><br />- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.<br /><br />- This can be used to remove cosmetics.<br /><br />- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.<br /><br />- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.<br /><br />- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.<br /><br />- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This was a lifesaver for our son with an acne issue! Being a 17yr. old boy who was feeling the high school inferiority angst at a time in life thats rough enough.. bc duh, it\u2019s High School!! He hoped for a solution to improve his condition and give a boost to his confidence. We ended at a dermatologist who gave us a regiment of:<br />1. wipe the counter clean of all gimmicks/products<br />2. use a dye/scent free soap and water x2 daily<br />3. follow up with clindamycin 1% to dab on larger<br />  trouble spots ONLY..!!<br />So, on our way to where we wanted to go... improvement was ours in leaps and bounds. Then, Covid... Then, the mask mandate!! Soon after we developed a sort of acne/rash on bridge of nose and around mouth 2\u201d due to synthetic material where the mask touches the face. Dr. said mask was compromising the skins ability to breathe and would subside after mandate lifted. Only, attending school x5 days a week 100% fully masked- didn't give skin any reprieve and with no end in sight, I went seeking help for acne irritation.<br /><br />As of now, we\u2019re on the 25th day of Geologie\u2019s 30 day regiment and I am so grateful we found this product. TBH, I personally didn't realize the extent of red, blotchy and puffiness this irritation had brought his poor skin.. until after using approx. 5 days- when we noticed a decrease in the puffy/red that had gradually appeared. Over the last 2wks- it has been clearing things up a little at a time and things seem less inflamed and aggravated. What I\u2019m most impressed with- this hasn\u2019t caused excess breakout like many other products in the past had done and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bc, of the compound. Nor, has it left skin overly dry.. and both of these are huge!! I\u2019m not even sure how it does it, maybe it\u2019s witchcraft?! For comparison: a BFF uses Proactiv (as seen on TV!) with her 2 son\u2019s for past x3 months and I\u2019m actually surprised the results we had seem similar but, in a lot less time!?<br /><br />The 2 bottles of product are easily identified and instructions are simple easy and straightforward- x1 AM/PM. I applaud the packaging as it doesn\u2019t have a feminine vibe, nothing \u201cfu-fu-\u201c to turn teen boys away from using \u201cgirl stuff!\u201d Trust me, I\u2019ve gone this route before- and it does matter to some! This is a non offensive clean smell and the product itself dissipates/absorbs into the skin easily after application. A few suggestions I have: leave out on bathroom counter to remind one to use daily, use fresh pillowcase every few days to keep any excess bacteria away, wash mask daily if poss. while this mandate applies.. and most of all- keep your hands away! Easier for adults- harder for teens.<br /><br />As with any product there are many factors to it success.. and for obvious reasons. I can\u2019t promise it will cure all issues but, I feel confident in saying you can expect improvement (if not extinct..) end results. I\u2019m so happy to have found this and will be looking into the entire product line for future maintenance use. Sorry so long winded.. I wanted to include details for any in a similar situation- I am hoping this info. may be helpful to someone else in need.. Be safe.", "label": 1}
{"text": "So, for a man who thinks his looks strike a resemblance to that of Anderson Cooper.. (bc, of the devilishly handsome silver fox short crew cut) mixed with a longer (3/4\u201d) faux-hawk frontal vibe.. this is a great product to work with this style as it complements the cut really well! As one who\u2019s always used hair gel (daily x30+ yrs!) it\u2019s hard to find one we have not tried. Bold Men casual- sold just under $20 for 3.3oz. Is a higher price point so, the expectations were high and happy to say, this came through impressively.<br /><br />This gel has an ability to last thru the day without becoming razor sharp quills nor, a crusty-crumbly flake after a full day of wear in tear. Being one who prefers a touchable hold (the hardest combo to find btw!!) this gives that to you.. We found, unlike cheaper store bought brands- less is more! (too much will weigh down the hair) **A trick of the trade for any who want to accomplish short spikes- use less product!!<br /><br />Best results came from using no more than  a nickel size amount onto towel (50%) dried hair.. and finger combing into place. The hold stays movably put.. performing better then ever expected- yay!! TBH, this may take getting used too.. IF, you\u2019re norm is the \u201cfrozen gel look!\u201d Hack: one can finger style hair into place with this- then, use blow dryer on a lower setting for just a moment.. it will expedite the setting process- giving specific direction to the final look. (A convertible would do the same but.. not sure It\u2019s feasible in winter ha ha!)<br /><br />Product is thick yet, offers just enough slip to give you pliability to style before it settles. Note: color is clear\u2026 It\u2019s just the container that is black! After hair is set, this absorbs vs. shellacs to the hair- letting hair have movement and touchable texture.. The scent is nice with a masculine appeal And after 3wks. of daily application we\u2019ve used approx. a tad over 1/4 of content (to give you an idea how long it will last..) thus far, washing daily we\u2019ve noticed no unwanted build up.. which is also a big deal- as this can lead to flakes/Dandruff..!! A good shampoo scrub removes product easily enough.. and paired with daily conditioner, it\u2019s not over-drying to the hair. Making the $ seem worth all the quality benefits.<br /><br />This is a top quality higher end product that best fits those who have a moveable set style they like their hair to maintain throughout the day.. this can achieve the desired look and look fantastic- and does so, without all the unwanted side effects that can come with daily use of hair gel.. I hope this info can help your decision\u2026 Feel free to let me know!", "label": 1}
{"text": "This was a great product made to be helpful For moisturizing but, also being sensitive enough for use on a newborns skin.

This product delivered!!<br /><br />After noticing a few dry spots on baby skin, I did some research on how to re-capture moisture necessary.. my concern was a bit of cradle cap and the use of Emelia\u2019s baby bath oil on the scalp. Not only was it very sensitive and user-friendly, it took care of the issue within a few days.. The other concern was the possibility of getting product in babies eyes, if added to the overall bathwater.. of course, I used my best efforts to keep this from happening- but, I found dipping washcloth into the water and wiping off face\u2026 Absolutely caused zero problems- I was totally surprised and impressed!!<br /><br />Knowing the African culture needs a bit of moisturizer in skin care as well as hair care\u2026 This has covered both needs in just this one product.

It also prevents the serum from dripping in your eyes. Another tip is to rub the mask on the backs of your hands before throwing it away. That skin needs special care also.

{"text": "I have for years dealt with dry, cracked heels, and I have tried a number of things to correct the issue. While my heels haven\u2019t hurt or anything, they have been ugly. In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It\u2019s a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven\u2019t worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br /><br />This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a \u201cbite\u201d to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br /><br />I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don\u2019t put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress \u2013 my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br /><br />After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they\u2019re not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br /><br />I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br /><br />This thing really works and it does a good job. It\u2019s slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well. I do recommend using some caution when working with this instrument as it is possible to overdo if not careful, which is probably very true of any tool of this type.", "label": 1}

This trimmer is a bit different than many of the others I have seen of its type which look more like mascara applicators.

Since November, I have tried Luminess, Belloccio, and Aeroblend foundations. I had hoped I would like Belloccio because it's half the price, but it could not compare to the Aeroblend Foundation.  The Luminess was too sticky, like it never set. The Aeroblend looks Absolutely Flawless. It takes minutes to do my makeup now, and so many people have asked me about my skin.

You can actually hear the anti-freeze/non-toxic liquid gel floating and bobbing around inside each stainless steel spoon/orb, and I love the ergonomic shape of each tool! The brightly colored turquoise handle tips help protect my fingers from the cold, and these futuristic-looking devices sit and balance nicely on various parts of my face! They do a great job of reducing swelling, puffiness, and fluid retention, and I think they\u2019d make an affordable and unique gift for fans of at-home, cold therapy techniques! \u2603\ufe0f", "label": 1}
{"text": "I absolutely love this dual-headed face roller!! It\u2019s gorgeously colored, easy to hold, attractively packaged, and competitively priced. I especially love using it after I\u2019ve cleansed my skin and applied moisturizer, right before I start putting on my makeup. It instantly helps depuff my skin, and it seems to enhance the smooth coverage of every cream and foundation I use immediately afterwards. It has definitely become part of my daily skincare routine, and the aluminum alloy rollers are super smooth and manage to apply the perfect amount of weighted pressure!", "label": 1}
{"text": "The lavender bath bomb and rose-scented bath bomb and soap bar all feature light, feminine scents that pair nicely with the included candle! The stainless steel cup seems well-constructed and nicely sized, and the various tools and bottle openers are an appreciated bonus.

I think this grouped assortment offers a nice variety of different and relaxing products that most customers would enjoy!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I\u2019ve used many Korean face masks before but never a hair mask specifically! I love that the treatments come packaged in individual pouches (which makes them perfect for travel), and I like that they come as a boxed set. After shampooing my hair and brushing it straight, it tucks easily into one of these pre-filled bags, and it\u2019s simple enough to squish and massage the conditioning product around. I usually keep one on for a couple of hours, and it seems like the body heat associated with activity and movement helps the essence really penetrate every strand.<br /><br />The attached straps are easy to affix and release, and the product washes out smoothly enough and manages to leave my hair super shiny too! I love that this formula contains a blend of kernel oil, fermented yeast extract, and soybean seeds because they mix nicely with all of the floral notes and botanical aromas! These deep-conditioning treatments seem to work wonders for my color-treated and often heat-styled hair!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I like the details of the twist-front designs on these stretchy headbands, and all of the fabrics feel soft and lightweight. Each one is easy enough to wash, and they come in a wide range of attractive colors, so I usually leave a couple in my car for unexpected hikes and impromptu workout sessions. They\u2019re also great for holding my hair back during morning and evening skincare sessions, so I\u2019d gladly recommend this multicolored variety pack to others!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I think this is a great set of utilitarian beauty tools! If you've ever tried to apply a goopy face mask with just your fingers (looking at you gold-infused charcoal paste), then you know the struggle that often comes with scooping up products and then trying to spread them evenly before they start to dry in place. These bendy silicone-tipped spatula brush sticks and paddles streamline the entire process!<br /><br />All of the tools are lightweight, easy to clean, and they seem to be fairly durable! I love the candy-colored palette of pastel hues, and the various textures and tips offer plenty of versatility and flexibility. They are also great for hygienically scooping up globs and dollops of various creams and moisturizers that need to be kept as sanitary as possible for repeated applications. I'd definitely recommend this tool set to others!", "label": 1}
{"text": "These medical-grade silicone scar removal sheets are so versatile! Acne scars, burn scars, and post-surgical scars all benefit from the consistent application of this painless product, and I love that it\u2019s a viable alternative to topically applied creams and gels. I love that the flexible material comes rolled up like tape, and I appreciate that it can be cut and trimmed into custom shapes and sizes. The chosen flesh tone would likely suit many users, so it at least provides a certain degree of modest skin camouflage.<br /><br />The silicone component brightens, hydrates, moisturizes, softens, and repairs damaged skin, so repeated use truly does seem to make a noticeable difference. Scars slowly start to fade as the skin regeneration process kicks into high gear, and these sheets are actually reusable, washable, flexible, breathable, and easy to apply!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I have tried and tested many rollers and scrapers recently, so I inspected this duo closely. The gold hardware on this dual-ended roller seems reliably attached, and both ends roll freely, but the larger end does seem to have a small issue that causes it to bump with each revolution, preventing the rolling motion from being completely smooth and silent. That being said, it still adequately applies smooth and even pressure to the face with each systematic use!<br /><br />The gua sha scraper exhibits some scattered scuffs and scrapes, and the edges and \u201cv\u201d angle have some rough, white areas they don\u2019t look perfectly polished, but all natural stones have imperfections to some degree. This set comes attractively packaged, and it seems to be affordably priced, so it might be a great choice for consumers looking for a starter facial set!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I\u2019ve greatly enjoyed using this organic clover honey face mask! The texture is smooth and dreamy, and it seems to offer me a very nourishing skin treatment every time I use it. It rinses away cleanly after 20-30 minutes of wear, and I also love that this bee-powered skincare product is made in the USA, so I\u2019d definitely recommend it to other consumers in search of a honey-infused facial concoction! Oh, and both the glass jar and paper box are recyclable, so it\u2019s an eco-conscious pairing all around. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\u267b\ufe0f", "label": 1}

Each headband is lightweight, adorably designed, and universally sized, and the elastic portions along the back feel reliable and secure. The decorative plastic buttons on each side can sustain some pull, so I believe that they\u2019re there to optionally provide a resting place for the ear loops of face masks. Regardless, I think all of the patterns are vivid and cute, so I\u2019d gladly recommend these boho hair accessories to others!", "label": 1}
{"text": "This foaming cleanser genuinely provides an oil-free approach to daily acne control. I like that it contains botanical extracts, and it seems to provide a gentle, yet thorough, clean!

I\u2019d recommend it to others without hesitation!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I can honestly say that this was the first time I\u2019ve ever applied a sheet mask to my behind, but I\u2019m always up for testing out new and inventive skincare items! Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they\u2019d be super easy to \u201cseat\u201d properly if you had an extra hand.<br /><br />I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you\u2019re standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn\u2019t experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I\u2019m not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br /><br />I\u2019m sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it\u2019s hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time. Overall, I think this is an intriguing novelty item that many consumers might find humorous, so for that reason alone, I think it\u2019s worth giving these a try!", "label": 1}
{"text": "This hand soap provides an effective and hygienic sense of all-natural clean! While I don\u2019t readily detect a heady scent of lavender oil, I will say that an earthy tea tree scent is freshly omnipresent. I love that this is a vegan, cruelty-free product that\u2019s been consciously sourced, packaged, and produced, and the included pump dispenser seems to be quite sturdy and reliable. I appreciate that the bottle arrived with a secure safety seal in place, and I definitely didn\u2019t have any product leak out during shipment. There\u2019s also an expiration date handily provided on the bottle\u2019s base.<br /><br />This slippery, soapy gel solution creates a visible sudsing effect, and it feels quite hydrating overall! It rinses away cleanly and leaves my family\u2019s hands feeling nice and soft every time. I love using essential oils to help provide a renewed sense of revitalization and freshness around my home, so I\u2019m gladly adding this Canadian hand wash to my daily cleansing arsenal.", "label": 1}

I love the super slick, shiny surface of this heart-shaped piece, and it\u2019s always cool to the touch at room temperature. It\u2019s comfortable to hold, has a very slim profile, and it always immediately provides a relaxing sense of rebalanced alignment. This gua sha tool also comes with a pink polishing cloth and a red leather storage pouch! The snap is secure and reliable, the stitching is straight, and the scraper device fits snugly inside. I\u2019m really pleased with this product overall!", "label": 1}
{"text": "These do make affordably unique party favor gifts! The holographic print diamond ring designs are pretty, and I think the featured wording is memorable and cute! I will say that these hair coils are slightly larger than several others I\u2019ve tried, so they don\u2019t seem to be as tight and stretchy as the ones I\u2019m generally used to, but they do make a nice \u201cring\u201d design for the card, and the iridescent shade of purple is really attractive. Since they all come squashed together in a plastic bag with a slide zipper, they do move around and bend a lot. Because of that, 3 of the 7 decorative backing cards I received had obvious crinkles and bends across one bottom corner. They did flatten back out for the most part, but I still wish I\u2019d received an entire set of pristine cards that were undamaged. They\u2019d make great gifts for bachelorette parties or bridal shower events!", "label": 1}
{"text": "This ivory-colored bath mitt comes packaged in a resealable pink pouch, and it\u2019s super lightweight! The packaging says it is 100% natural silk, but it does look and feel more like a linen/cotton fabric. Regardless, it\u2019s soft enough to be gentle, but just textured enough to provide some noticeable friction for exfoliation! It fits comfortably over my hand, and it\u2019s simple enough to grip and hold and air dry after each use. It can be used alone with warm water, but I\u2019ve used it in combination with several body scrubs and it further works to enhance the gritty benefits of all of my exfoliating sugar and salt concoctions. I\u2019d recommend this natural glove for all skin types, and it can be used in conjunction with bath OR shower time. I\u2019d realistically pay $12-$15 for it, but I\u2019m pleased with its overall performance!", "label": 1}
{"text": "Vitamin C is definitely an essential component of a healthy body and skincare routine, and I love that this smooth cream also contains shea butter, vitamin E oil, rosemary, jojoba oil, aloe vera, cocoa butter, and lavender essential oil. This lotion has a pleasant scent, and it seems to work great with overnight applications. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized the next morning, and it has even helped diminish the appearance of minor blemishes over time. I love that this product is USDA-certified organic and that it\u2019s made in small batches in the USA! The tub comes adequately sealed with a clearly marked expiration date, and I think it\u2019s affordably priced for the results it provides. \ud83c\udf24", "label": 1}

This product would make a chic and affordable gift for yourself or a loved one!", "label": 1}
{"text": "The blend of royal jelly, botanical, and floral extracts gives this Korean beauty essence a nice ingredient profile, and the overall scent is pleasingly fresh and sweet. Each of the pouches has a small twist-off cap and the liquid contents are clear (and seem to have a high water content). The spread solution initially dries a little stickier than I\u2019d prefer it to (stickier than a well-absorbed moisturizing lotion would), but the eventual result feels hydrating overall. Due to the compact size and flattened shape, these pouches would be great for travel. Especially after a day at the beach!", "label": 1}
{"text": "These nipple covers aren't perfect in every way, but they do offer some reassuring coverage! I do like that they come in 2 different shapes, and I like that they\u2019re super lightweight and easily portable. The satin coverings are soft and smooth, and the light beige hue is an acceptable shade that would complement several skin tones. I will say that the paper backings don\u2019t peel off smoothly every time, and the fabric has a slight tendency to wrinkle and ripple, so the covers don\u2019t stay completely flat throughout the entire duration of wear. The rippled texture is still somewhat visible under t-shirts, the edges are slightly detectable, and I think I\u2019d have to layer two of them together to really ensure full coverage. I\u2019ve had no adverse reactions to the adhesive component, they peel off easily, and I even wore a pair while sweating in the summer heat in Texas, and they stayed firmly in place.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This boxed set of smooth, golden eye mask pairs is totally fabulous! Each pair comes individually packaged, making this collected group of beauty accessories excellent swag-bag additions or party favor gifts! The included serum feels incredibly hydrating and smells absolutely divine. I\u2019ve used several different brands of similar eye masks, and these are noticeably thicker and more substantial than every other pair I\u2019ve tried! Even at room temperature, they instantly provide a cooling sensation when applied to the face. They adhere well to skin, but due to their weight and size, they do have a slight tendency to slip downward with gravity. For that reason, I suggest lying flat or reclining while wearing them, so that they stay as close to the lower lash line as possible. Each package still contains some extra serum after the eye masks are removed, so I massage that residual liquid onto my neck for added moisture potential. The combination of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and 24k nanogold particles leaves my under eye area feeling incredibly hydrated and refreshed. Consistent use of this product helps combat fine lines, puffiness, and dark circles over time, so I\u2019m thrilled the whole set is so affordable! I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this product.", "label": 1}

I love that it contains aloe vera, vitamin C, rose hip oil, and lemon and orange peels! \ud83c\udf4b It goes on smoothly, rinses off easily, and seems to have an ideal consistency. I have gladly added this vegan product to my daily skincare regimen, and I\u2019d order it again without hesitation. It provides smoothing, hydrating, radiant results and it smells incredibly delightful!", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a beautiful and affordably priced facial set! The Brazilian rose quartz stones are a pale shade of pearlescent pink, and the rose gold hardware is the perfect complement to them! The rollers move silently, as promised, and they don\u2019t seem to rust or wear out in any way. The stones are cool to the touch at room temperature, but placing them in the refrigerator (before use) ensures an ultra-chilled experience. I love that the magnetic box lid has instructions printed on the underneath side, and the soft, drawstring pouch is an added bonus! The set even comes with a informational mineral card that provides reassuring details about the quartz pieces featured. Each tool is perfectly nestled within in its own compartmentalized cutout, and the rollers definitely seem to help increase circulation and boost overall skin radiance! This would definitely make a perfect gift set for someone!", "label": 1}

There is a  bit of a scent that I find to be medicinal though it fades quickly.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if its normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo).

{"text": "I love how easily and quickly  Tinazana's Pineapple Deep Cleanser becomes a creamy lather that feels really nice on my face.  A very small amount of the cleanser does a great job of deeply cleaning pores and removing dead skin cells. My face feels fresh and clean after cleansing. But it does dry out my skin a bit.  Because I follow up using toner and moisturizer, this isn't a huge deal for me and doesn't prevent me from continuing to use Tinazana cleanser.  There is a light, faint, fresh scent that I enjoy. Surprisingly, it doesn't smell like pineapple to me.  It also doesn't last; when I rinse the cleanser off, I can no longer detect the scent at all.<br /><br />Due to skin sensitivity issues, I sometimes have issues with citrus based products. I know pineapple technically isn't a citrus fruit but I was a bit concerned it might be too harsh on my skin. Its not. No burning or itching at all.<br /><br />I like this cleanser a lot. Does a great job, even with drying my skin a bit.  The price is reasonable. This is a cleanser I will continue to use and I recommend it.<br /><br />My overall rating is 4.5 stars.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I LOVE Hask hair products. I'm a huge fan and have been for some time. So, I was super excited test Hask's body wash.  But I had a problem right from the start. I had to decide between 4 fantastic choices!  Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.  The aloe helps hydrate and moisturize my dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />The 2 bottles are big in size and will last for quite some time in our home.  That, along with the great results make the price reasonable. Recommended!", "label": 1}
{"text": "John Frieda's Detox shampoo/conditioner duo is an excellent way to revive and restore hair. The shampoo does a brilliant job of not only cleansing hair, it cleanses the scalp and washes away buildup leaving hair soft and shiny.  The conditioner detangles, hydrates and adds bounce to even the driest hair.<br /><br />Both have a nice scent though it doesn't last long, at least not in my hair!  Each is easy to work into hair and rinse out as well.  I like to use this duo once a week. I experience no color fading or allergic reactions as I have sensitive skin.  Definitely worth the price and absolutely recommended!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I'm so amazed by boar bristle hairbrushes and how incredible they make hair look and feel.  This GAINWELL boar bristle brush is a wonderful, compact brush. It may be small but it works wonders on our family's hair.  It works through tangles without pulling or causing pain while leaving hair soft, shiny and manageable.  The compact size makes it perfect for travel, to keep in a purse, a school/gym locker, briefcase or even a pocket.  If you've never experienced a boar bristle brush, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. You can't be the price and the results will be worth it!  If, for some reason you're not satisfied, GAINWELL asks you to contact them for assistance. I can't imagine they receive a ton of calls with issues but its great to know customer service is a  priority!", "label": 1}
{"text": "Thanks to dry, sensitive skin, I'm always a bit concerned when trying new skin care products. With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier.  It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask.  I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job!  It applies nice and easy.  I let it sit on my skin for 10 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water, right before its nearly dry.  It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away.  My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley.  This mask does have a light scent but it doesn't last long. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I use it twice a week though I could probably get away with using it only a week because the results Huxley delivers are long lasting.<br /><br />I'm so relieved I will be able to continue to use this mask on my skin. Silly as it may sound  I kind of feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it-it makes my skin feel that GOOD!  I will continue to use/purchase Huxley, I'm that satisfied/impressed with what it does for my skin.  I absolutely recommend Huxley.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I take Melatonin to help me sleep just about every night.  I had NO CLUE melatonin helps improve skin condition as well!  I have very positive results when I take it to help me sleep. I'm guessing it plays a role in why I experience  great results with MU TENUTO Bereceuse Water Gel cream as well! I love the consistency of this cream. Its a nice, light gel.  It doesn't take much cream at all to cover my face. It applies/spreads so easily on skin.  The first time I used it, I was concerned that it was going to be sticky.  Fortunately, that's not the case.  It absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth immediately.  I can not only see it but I can feel how it hydrates my skin as well. My skin is normally extremely sensitive and very dry.  The hydration really makes my skin feel great.  I apply the cream at night before bed and enjoy the results in the morning when I awaken.  Lavender is one of my favorite scents.  But I just do not care much for the scent of this cream.  I will not deduct a star from my rating due to the scent...the scent doesn't last long at all.  I don't think its fair to penalize the cream for a scent that doesn't last long.  I have no negative reactions to MU TENUTO. It works and feels great on my sensitive skin.  For those interested in packaging, the jar is glass-nice and heavy with music notes all around it. And here's a neat feature...if you scan the QR code on the package, a snippet of classic music will play on your Smart phone! That's pretty neat.<br /><br />I love what MU  TENUTO does for my skin and works with the very first use!  I find the price reasonable.  This is an excellent cream-it takes wonderful care of my dry, sensitive skin. Definitely recommended!", "label": 1}

{"text": "Should I start my review by telling you how incredibly creamy Easydew Daily face wash is? How it  makes my skin feel great as I'm washing with Easydew and even better after I've rinsed it off? How much I love the scent?<br /><br />Don't worry, I'll tell you everything! This is  my first ever Easydew product. In fact, prior to seeing this face wash in my VINE offers, I'd never even heard of Easydew brand products.  I'm so happy I ordered it.<br /><br />A nice, thin line of the wash dispenses from the tube.  (The tube is very sturdy and durable, for those interested in packaging) Now, the wash starts out like a kind of lotion but it lathers quickly and easily into a light, whipped foam. ( A dime size amount is all I need to sufficiently cover my face/forehead.  ) The whipped foam is SO creamy and it just feels so darn good as I apply it and when its on my face.  IDK if its possible but I swear I can feel it cleaning, hydrating and moisturizing my skin pretty much immediately.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow.  It looks and feels so good and healthy. It feels fresh.  And it feels that way long after I've used Easydew.  Easydew leaves my skin feeling like it did when I was younger-before I used makeup, before I spent too much time in the sun unprotected.  It feels revived and I just love that feeling!  Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book.  It works great and makes my skin look/feel great. The ingredients and what they do for skin is impressive. (I recommend taking a minute to read the info above regarding the ingredients!)  The scent is wonderful (though it vanishes VERY quickly).  And I have no issues using it on my dry, very sensitive skin.  The price is more than reasonable, especially with the results the wash brings and the fact only a small amount is needed when I wash my face.  Easydew is officially  a part of my daily skin care  routine now.  I absolutely recommend Easydew!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I am finding SO many uses for Shiny Leaf's coconut and sweet almond oil! I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil.  Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.  I recently learned that it can help fade scars so I've begun to rub some sweet almond oil into a scar on my finger to see what happens. If it helps, I'll then move on to a small facial scar I have. I'm also trying something on my own; just started doing this a few days ago.  I get nosebleeds every single day, at least once a day, throughout the winter when the heat is on in the house. This started when I was 2 years old, I'm now 49 so I've experienced this my entire life.  I now rub a small amount of sweet almond oil under my nostrils before bed.  Since starting this, I continue to have nosebleeds. Yesterday, I had only one and it involved just a few drops of blood. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.  ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!) I have NO clue if its just a coincidence or if the sweet almond oil is helping in any way but I'm going to continue using it.<br /><br />These oils are phenomenal! Both bottles are 16oz.  I love the fact that they have normal caps on them but pumps for each bottle are included as well.  The liquid of each is thinner oil than I expected, which I prefer.  Both absorb quickly. Neither has a scent.  I've found SO many uses for these oils, I can't wait to discover more. ( I'm SO happy with these oils, I recently purchased Shiny Leaf's biotin hair conditioner and cannot wait to try it! ) I find the price to be incredibly reasonable, especially since you're getting TWO bottles of oils! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />*FYI...the mist bottle on the end in my photo is NOT included! I used one of my  own mist bottles to combine both oils.  You will get both bottles AND pumps that you see in my photo, NOT the mist sprayer!", "label": 1}

Because I have  sensitive skin that's precisely what  I did.  I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me.

{"text": "I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf.

{"text": "If you're a dog owner, its practically guaranteed at some point, you will have to deal with your dog having dirty, muddy paws. Happens often with our bichon Mac. (Naturally, it recently happened right after I cleaned and mopped the house! lol)  I ordered the Mr. Ros automatic cleaner for small/medium dogs. Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy.  Its roughly 8\"tall  and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes.  The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn't use soap) Turn the washer on-it does make noise though its  not terribly loud at all-and place the dog's paw in the washer for 1-2 minutes. Dry each paw with a towel after cleaning. Mac wasn't thrilled throughout the cleaning process but he also wasn't really scared by it. My husband started to pour out the dirty water before I could stop him so you won't see much,  but you can see in my photo the water is discolored a bit following the cleaning.  If a wet towel isn't enough to clean Mac's muddy/dirty paws, my regular cleaning method is to put some lukewarm water in a small bowl , dunk each paw one at a time and use my hand to remove the dirt from his fur while submerged. Quite honestly, I really don't see much of a difference between that cleaning method and the Dr. Ros paw washer. Perhaps results vary depending on the breed of dog but for our bichon, I really don't see a  difference.", "label": 1}
{"text": "You know the saying 'kill two birds with one stone'? That is precisely what I had in mind when I ordered Follain Mattifying Moisturizer.  I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.

I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.

It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.

I've worn these lashes all day and even slept in them a night or two just to see how well they'd hold up. They held up amazingly. I've purchased an additional black and clear eyeliner to go with my kit. I prefer these over the magnetic eyeliner with magnetic lashes because it concerns me that the magnetic eyeliner may be found to have adverse effects at some point. Oh, additionally, this eyeliner goes on so well as a good as the adhesive works with the lashes it doesn't have a tacky feeling on your eye.

{"text": "Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products. They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since. They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes. Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work. It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place. I'm one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place. The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort. Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny- like someone who has had a little too much to drink. I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips. The best thing to do is read a book. The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.<br /><br />Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place. But the results should make you happy. At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself. Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one's teeth. I didn't like the idea of hassling with strips so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first. I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results. And I did get good results with these strips. I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days. This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed. I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist's use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed. They are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage. They also come with a money back guarantee. In order to get the guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips work well, but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel. They will not whiten dentures, caps, crowns, or other artificial dental material. If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective. I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth. They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy. They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The brush is really nice, good craftsmanship with a thick substantial handle.  It deserves to be loved, but only if you're right-handed.  The way the bristles are angled makes the brush upside-down in a left hand.  Sure, you can use the long bristles, but that defeats the purpose of the angle which really does make the brush go through whiskers more easily.  We Southpaws are very used to this.  So many products designed to fit in a hand are made for the right hand, which makes them awkward or ineffective (like scissors) for 10% of us.  When that happens, I find that I don't reach for that item as often, or I avoid it altogether, and, sadly, this fine brush sits seldom-used in my bathroom.  Maybe some future version could have the peak of the bristles in the middle with an angle on both sides.  You vast-majority-of-right-handers will love this brush.", "label": 1}

{"text": "At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can't be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as \"Frenzy\" in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it's on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband's) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than a pretty face, and isn't for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There's a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it's time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you're pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There's a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men's facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You'll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn't very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don't need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I'm afraid I'll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007", "label": 0}

The booklets are smaller than a credit card size and you can use these very discreetly, while at dinner or cocktails etc. No need to go to a restroom to re-apply make up.

I have had to order for several of them.<br /><br /> I have several booklets which I keeps handy - one in the car, in a few handbags.

At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage.<br /><br /> This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines.

{"text": "I wanted to try the breathable nail polish. I prefer frosts or pearls, and pinks. My favorite polish is by another company in a rose gold.<br /><br />The photos included for this polish clearly look rose gold. Sure, different monitors, screens, etc etc, but everything else has been spot on, EXCEPT this polish.<br /><br />First off, I love the rubberized top. It makes it so easy to handle. The polish itself flowed well and went on smoothly.<br /><br />My beef is the huge color difference. I've already opened it, I can't return it. It totally looks rosy and pearlized in the photos on Amazon. BUT, in reality, it is mauve, nearly purple. The color name is \"Pinky Promise\", so the minimum I expected was a shade of pink. They should change the name to \"Purple Promise\", which would be much more accurate. It is so different, I thought maybe I was sent the wron bottle. But the sticker on the bottom has the right name. Maybe someone messed with stickers?<br /><br />It is not a horrible color, but not what I wanted, and very dark for me. Very disappointing. The quality is ok, but the shade is WAY off from the photo and name.<br /><br />UPDATE: Found the weakness in this polish. Despite it being so dark, I wanted to test the \"breathable\" polish, as I'd never tried it. I have to say that it lasted really well. I put it on with no bottom or top coat, just the polish. It was still going strong, no chips or flaking, four days later.<br />Until I did a big batch of dishes.<br />I usually wear gloves to wash dishes (yes, sadly, we have no dishwasher where we live. It's like the 1950's). However, I wanted to test the polish, so wore my usual glove on my right hand, and no glove on the left.<br />Water, for prolonged time, is this polish's kryptonite!

The \"row height\" is fixed at about 1 1/8\", but the \"cell width\" is totally adjustable by moving the plastic tabs around.  The tabs move easily and seat securely, making reconfiguring a piece of cake.<br /><br />All of this versatility combines to make this incredibly useful for paper crafters.

{"text": "#21 light neutral beige, and it is a pretty good match to my fair, cool skin.<br /><br />My skin: fair, dry, mid 40s, pink cheeks from Rosacea (visible veins, zero acne). I find that this has light natural coverage using a foundation brush. It tones down my redness with ease. It can be built up, especially if allowed to semi dry between applications. I really like that it has SPF (PA++++) 50. I always use sunscreen, so adding this on top of my sunscreen base is just added protection. Also perfect for reapplication & touch ups through day.<br /><br />I also find that it is hydrating on my dry skin. Has a dewy finish. My natural skin comes through but looks better- more spruced up and put together looking. I do notice that the finish depends on what I use before hand. When I have used this on bare skin, it has a more mattifying appearance. When I use on top of my moisturizer and/or moisturizing sunscreen, then it has a more dewy radiant look. I prefer the latter.<br /><br />Seems to stay in place. I applied some to my forearm, and it is still in place a couple hours later.

{"text": "I have used this before! I had used several GoMay products about a two years ago. I have liked them all, and there are some products that I have repurchased (love their aminos face wash). I remember really liking this night cream, and so when it came up as an option to try, I thought maybe it was another version, but no it is the same. I think the change has been in the company. They were entirely a Chinese brand, and now I see USA labeling- but I think it is still a Chinese beauty product. Same stuff that I know and love. Same press down dispenser container. I am copying over my old review as the info is all the same, and my experience is the same. While I dont rate on price, I am pleased at its effectiveness and how it is half the price of similar items I have used.<br /><br />Safe, effective moisturizing product with promising ingredients. I am used to using several of these ingredients, and I must stress that it is important to use SPF when using anything with retinol. I saw that this has quite a list of ingredients that I am not totally familiar with, so I went through each one and looked them up. I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays. So again, wear your SPF when using any retinol based products.<br /><br />--GoMay is a Chinese (turned USA) beauty company and from everything I have used, the products have been impressive in formulation and the thought and safety put into creating it.<br /><br />--Awesome, attractive container. Has a press down lid that pops out some product. Keeps it clean and safe! BUT if you want to get into the container, the lid does come off.<br /><br />--Minimal scent- naturally occurring. Can't quite put my finger on the aroma. It dissipates quickly, and it is really faint. Like green tea and plain yogurt.<br /><br />--The cream absorbs quickly. It just soaks right into my skin. I have skin that leans dry, and I do follow up with either a hydrating sunscreen, or if used at night I add a thicker emollient.

{"text": "When the times comes to wash my face, this mascara comes off extra easy. I didnt realize how much other mascaras left behind, once I did my usual face wash (oil cleanse to start, then follow up with water based), and the mascara began to break down right away. Very pleased with that.<br /><br />This SkyHigh mascara is actually lengthening. I have basic lashes, and I dont expect anything magical from mascara. But this is noticeable on my lashes, and as I was swiping it on I could see the lashes looking elongated. Not clumpy (that's good or bad depending on the look you are going for). This has more natural look. I haven't noticed any flaking, definitely no smudging. My eyes are easily irritated by makeup, and this mascara doesnt seem to bother me. I can wear it on both upper and lower lashes.<br /><br />At a budget friendly price ($5 for 1, or $7 for pack of 2), it is worth trying. I would consider it again at this price.

{"text": "An adorable shower cap that fits my large head. It says it fits up to 24\" head, and mine measures 23.5\". Then I have loads of hair- semi thick, nearly waist length. It all fits! Yet isn't a big bulbous excess of material either. But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I dont notice my hair getting wet at all, but I dont put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly good. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I dont use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly do well for that too. Also, if I had pool.. while it isnt a pool cap, if I just wanted something to help keep excess water off my hair while casually wading in a pool, this very well could work for that too.", "label": 1}

I have another Phoera kit, and I like it a lot.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B093GFPFP9<br /><br />I am not sure if Nude (#102) is the lightest shade they have or not, but if you are like me and have fair skin with cool undertones this may lean a little warm. It isn't bad, but if they had a better match available I would want to get that.<br />THEY DO!! this is for fair with pink undertones<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RZ6QZLJ/<br /><br />The BB cushion is a tad lighter, and a better match for my skin. I do like both. I tend to like cushion over liquid, but both of these are fantastic. I really like how these feel, and despite being a  little warm on my cool skin, the make up looks good on the skin. Doesn't settle into every nook and cranny, nor dry flakes.<br />My skin is 40+ so this is something I look for in make up.<br /><br />The primer is fantastic. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Use less than you think you need lest you want a more oily look to seep through. I find that primers like this are great for dry skin, and for more dry feeling foundations.. but their foundations arent drying. So less is more with their primer.<br /><br />The formula for the liquid foundation really impresses me. Staying power is good. Skin feels comfortable. Skin looks healthy. I can touch my skin after and it doesn't feel like there is make up on. Provides really good coverage with a little bit yet doesn't look cakey and fake. Can be built up. I would recommend this over dermablend, personally. All my redness disappears (from Type 1 Rosacea). To provide a more sheer wash, just change up your application- use a damp sponge to put it on, or use a damp sponge as last step to blend it in and lighten it up.<br /><br />I really think it is worth the try. I wasn't even going to try this, but since they provided so much information in their product description it really piqued my interest. If you need coverage with a natural look.. try this!", "label": 1}
{"text": "Not shiny, not matte, somewhere in between. They call it semi-matte, and I agree. But anyone who has lines or parched lips, should always avoid any formulation with the word \"matte\" in it. You are better off with a lip liner and a moisturizing lip gloss or lip stick. Matte will always dry down and make the lip skin pucker a little. My lips aren't wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br /><br /> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn't feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br /><br />The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br /><br />The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I'm not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all.

I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion). No matter, I am pleased with my experience with Organa Cell products so far. SO much so that I have been looking into other products. I am a big fan of K-beauty, and will likely buy their sunscreen soon.<br /><br />Now, I have no idea what the full ingredient list. I will double check the packaging to see if it is there. I went to their website (Korean, so you will need a web translator) and they do not have the full ingredient  list shown (unless I missed it). Pretty much what you see on this product page is what you will see on their actual web page.

Great for sensitive skin as it has components to help protect, build, maintain skin barrier.<br /><br />I dont rate based on price, we all have our own budgets. Organa Cell is pricier than most K-beauty I try, but it is still a brand I would recommend.

{"text": "It works! Comes down to preference. I use dry shampoo often. I prefer the powder over the spray. I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style. OR apply some before bed and wake up to fresh hair.<br /><br />It doesn't take much. I have used other brands with similarly small containers, and the stuff lasts forever even with frequent use. This is a little smaller at 1.5 ounces, which they state is travel size-- but it will still provide many applications. At $9.99, I think the price is great (even though I do not rate on price)- and I will likely buy this again but in the dark hair option (more about that in a moment).  This is a nozzle tip dispenser. Squeeze bottle to get it to disperse. Be sure to take the protective seal off from inside the cap. Mine was stuck up in the cap. It took me a few humorous attempts to get the product out from nozzle before I realized that the safety seal was caught up inside. Once I got through that snafu, all was good to go.<br /><br />I failed to see that this is for \"light hair\". It is a pale yellow powder. \"This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this \u2018poo is for you\". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn't matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look. If not too much is used, and if it is brushed out well enough rarely is there any noticeable haze. Again, I am used to working with the powder form so it comes easy to me to get it to work.<br /><br />My hair was freshened up as expected. A light lift. Not a massive amount of volume, though over course of day I noticed it seemed more full (I have very long hair, so the roots will be weighed down a bit at first). No problems. I like it.

Typical viscosity among my other K-beauty brands.<br /><br />I have a wide assortment of sunscreen, of various formulations and types. It is my #1 skin care product as I use it daily all year long. It is a habit. I avoid the sun for a few reasons, so sunscreen is vital to my well being. I live in a variable climate (from dry, freezing temps to humid hot) and I have sunscreen preference depending on season and situation. I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it). So a sunscreen such as this is easy to use, makes my skin feel good, and easy to reapply throughout the day. I dont wear make up usually, but for sake of review I used it under a light foundation tint. Seems to play well- I didnt notice any rolling/pilling. I'll use it up. I have also used it over other skin care (hydrating toner, serum, light moisturizer) and it worked well on top of all that too.<br /><br />Not sure yet if it will be repurchase.

{"text": "This is a gommage!!! The most gentle of all the physical exfoliation out there. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend. I also highly recommend anything by Easydew. Good stuff!  Know that this is meant to clump! Not supposed to have lather or creaminess. I had looked at the ingredients and some of the description and I suspected a gommage. The directions on box say to use on wet face and that it will lather. It doesn't. There is some clumps, but not as much as if it were used on a dry face, which is what is expected from a gommage. We want glorious clumps! For best results use on a clean dry face, not a wet face. I have tried it both ways, definitely use on dry face. Works but not as good on wet face.<br /><br />So use a generous amount. Just pat it in all over. Let it sit a moment, then massage it in in gentle circular motion. As you do so, small clumps will form. This is a combination of product and grime and dead skin cells. Basically, a \"gommage\" is like an eraser on a pencil, and your skin is paper. The graphite marks are dirt and dead skin cells. The product once applied is like that eraser-- it is removing those \"marks\". What happens when you use an erase? You start to see balled up pieces of eraser mixed with the graphite/pencil marks. That is more or less what is happening here. Those balled up pieces are a mix of product, dirt, and cells. Rinse, and carry on with rest of your routine. It is a very gentle \"peel\". And quite effective. But less so when used on wet skin-- the ingredients just can't grab the gunk on face as well. I'm surprised there is such a discrepancy in instructions.<br /><br />Instructions on container:<br />\"How to use:<br />Apply desired amount of peeling gel and work into a rich lather by wet hands.<br />Gently cleanse by massaging thoroughly over face in circles, avoiding eye contour.<br />Rinse off with lukewarm water.\"<br /><br />But the pictures clearly show what is expected--balled up bits/clumps.<br /><br />SO, it it may be a matter of terminology/language.

As for lengthening, lifting, volumizing, etc is meaningless in comparison. This DOES NOT IRRITATE (!!) YAY!!! Also, the blackest black is wonderfully black; makes my brown eyes pop. My lashes are well coated, making them look thicker, and there is a lift that I greatly appreciate as my lashes otherwise angle downward. Length is notable too. My lashes are nomrally ho-hum. Not thick, not thin, not long, more on short side, and angle down. This mascara is pleasing me. I dont care for make up except for mascara, but I rarely find one worthwhile.

{"text": "Hopefully the bottle I received was an oversight in aging inventory. My bottle was hard to get open, and once I did I could immediately tell that the oil had oxidized. Totally unusable as it was truly rancid. The oil was thick, all cakds up around the topper, and the bulb dropper was rock hard. I was unable to squeeze it. I think the dropper had dry rotted, then that allowed air into the bottle, leading to a rancid product. It was evident not just based on looks, but also that super special aroma of a rancid oil. Too bad, as I love seed oils for use on body, face, and hair. This had to go directly into garbage. Not at all usable as something with anti-oxidants become PRO-oxidant when exposed to air. This is going to do exactly the opposite of what you want. Again, I give benefit of the doubt. I imagine it was a bad bottle and hopefully not at all what anyone should expect.

Not even more than a basic mascara.

{"text": "I've only just begun using this, so this is a first impression review. I am fairly familiar with the active ingredients and understand how they work (and that they do work, so I expect this to continue that). The new part is the pearl extract, which has both immediate effect and longer term use benefit. I can attest to the immediacy, and it will be with using this for greater amount of time to determine if it a repurchase or not. As I learn more, I will share more. Here is a break down of what is in it and what to expect:<br /><br />BLANCHET GLAM PEARL RADIANCE CAPSULE SERUM is a supremely light weight gel serum with hint of floral scent from lavender, geranium, rose, and sandalwood. Barely detectable.  A little goes a long way. This weightless serum adds a mild level of healthy sheen. Korean Beauty emphasizes healthy skin, hydrated skin, supple skin, dewy, glowing skin. It is never matte. So while you could cover this with your foundation or powder, KB is all about letting natural skin shine through. The gentle, mild barely there sheen provides more of a glass look than a shiny look. Subtle. As for the rest... The primary active ingredients are NIACINAMIDE (2%) and ADENOSINE (.04%).<br /><br />NIACINAMIDE is a skin care work horse. It provides a variety of benefit to all skin types, ages, and concerns. It is a water-soluble vitamin (B3) that works with the natural substances in your skin to help improve skin barrier, fix past damage, visibly minimize enlarged pores, tighten lax pores, improve uneven skin tone, soften fine lines and wrinkles, diminish dullness, and strengthen a weakened surface. As I hone in on ingredients that pack the greatest punch, niacinamide has stood out as a must have ingredient in my skin care routine. I especially like it for its ability to brighten pigmentation. It also is one of few ingredients that work well with other ingredients without concern for contraindication or nullification. Skin care can get tricky, and this ingredient is just so easy to work with- so go ahead and use it with retinol, peptides, acids, etc. Niacinamide simply helps skin be healthy and look healthy and radiant. As with most skin care, it can take several weeks to several months of consistent use to see changes. This serum will help over time, but other ingredients provide an instant radiant glow.<br /><br />ADENOSINE is a rising star in anti aging products. There are studies that demonstrate that adenosine is an effective ingredient for improving the appearance of wrinkles, in both the eye and mouth area. Interestingly, adenosine directly affects the production of type I and type III collagen in the skin by binding to A2A receptors in fibroblast cells. So if it can help boost (or at least maintain) collagen, and help collagen from breaking down (collagen is what keeps our skin plump. Compare your 45 year old face to your 18 year old face, if your face now looks \"thinner\" despite no losing weight, it is the decrease of collagen that has produced that look). Since adenosine has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen, applying it topically can help to prevent (and somewhat even reverse) wrinkles. *thumbs up*<br /><br />80% FERMENTED PEARL EXTRACT is rich in amino acids and trace minerals that are highly moisturizing, soothing, and brightening. I must say, this is something that is new to me. Before this product, I had no idea that there was a use for pearl extract. It is used in topical skin care products as well as for use internally. I really dont know much about any of this, but a cursory search led me to a few interesting bullet points:<br />-Increases skin's collagen production<br />-Helps repair skin's damaged cells<br />-Lightens skin's tone and improves blemishes<br />-Diminishes fine lines and wrinkles<br />-Controls oil and shine<br />-Reduces pores and promotes smoother skin<br />-It has soft hues which shift subtly from direct to side views<br /><br />PURPOSE<br />Skin Brightening<br />Anti wrinkle<br /><br />Uses<br />High-intensity brightening lotion with 80% of fermented pearl extract in capsule technology<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />ACTIVE:Niacinamide,Adenosine<br />INACTIVE: water, dipropylene,  Glycol,1,2-Hexanediol,Agar,Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer,Synthetic Fluorphlogopite,Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891),Polyglyceryl-10Laurate,Polyglyceryl-10Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin,Hydrolyzed Pearl,Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil,Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil,Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Oil,Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil,Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil,Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil,Glycerin,Propanediol Hydroxyacetophenone,1,2-Hexanediol ,Centella Asiatica Extract,Butylene Glycol,Propanediol ,Portulaca Oleracea Extract,1,2-Hexanediol Centella Asiatica Extract,1,2-Hexanediol ,Panax Ginseng Leaf/Stem Extract Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract,1,2-Hexanediol , Hydrolyzed corn starch Beta vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract,Glycerin,Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glutathione,Plankton extract,Disodium EDTA,Tromethamine Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer,Xanthan Gum", "label": 1}
{"text": "This review is for the foot wipes only. I was intrigued as I do foot masks once a month, and I am always otherwise giving my feet attention every night. Sometimes I take a wash cloth to them, so these wipes are rather convenient when I am sitting in bed ready to lotion up but didnt take a wash cloth to them yet. These are quicker, easier, and nicer feeling than a wet rag. These aren't all that wet but I managed to wipe down both feet effectively enough. 14 wipes, individually wrapped. Suggested that only one wipe per foot.. so seven uses from this box.<br /><br /> The individual packets are convenient but wasteful if not using them on the go. I dont know how much benefit they offer beyond a basic wipe down. Non irritating, non drying. Not loving them enough to be a repurchase.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot- leaves my hair soft, manageable, and healthy looking. I added in this serum as I hoped to gain hair density or at least reduce loss (or reduce cycle frequency and/or duration). I dont have trouble growing my hair, I have trouble keeping it. So my hair is long, but much less dense than previous years. I transitioned from minoxidil to this. I wont do that again, as any gains I got from minoxidil were lost-- and I do contribute some of that to not using this as consistently as I did that. I'll explain what went into that below. This serum helped the condition of my hair and scalp, so I think it works well with minoxidil instead of in lieu of it. I likely wont continue with the serum for a few reasons.<br /><br />1. there was no instruction as to how to use this product. It is a dropper bottle, and I pretty much just used it like I did with minoxidil-- massaged whatever I pulled with dropper and distributed all over scalp, primarily at crown. Was this the correct way to do it? no idea. *<br /><br />2. It does say to apply to clean hair. Well, many of us do not wash our hair every single day. I have long curly hair that leans dry and there is no need to wash it daily. So I am either applying this to unwashed scalp daily or it only gets applied a few times a week.  Hence the lack of consistency. So right here it eliminates some would-be users if it has to be on a fresh washed scalp.<br /><br />3. the dropper is uncomfortable. I do not want to drop it from the dropper. I want to run it across the scalp so as to keep it from getting on my hair. The dropper is a little sharp feeling (at least my bottle that I received). I like the dropper style, and my thought is that if I were to buy this again, I would use a dropper from an old minoxidil bottle instead.<br /><br />4. How long should this bottle last? Since I had no idea how much I should use, I often wondered if I used too much or too little. Any new hair treatment needs to be given 4-6 months of consistent use to see results, if any. I know the shampoo and conditioner helped, and this serum has great ingredients that will help existing hair and scalp health.. but the inconsistency on my part from lack of instructions as well as expectation of using on fresh washed hair made it impossible to see if I could get benefit from it.<br /><br /> * \"It is best applied to damp hair after showering. We recommend visually splitting your scalp into 4 sections/quadrants. Depending on the amount of hair, use around 3-5 drops per quadrant. I like to drop into fingers and work into scalp. The remaining amount on your fingers you can work through your hair. It is perfectly fine to use the serum many times a day. That being said, it is important that the scalp/hair is clean\" (--I saw this written in the community question section of this page. Including this on box or in a leaflet would have been greatly helpful)<br /><br />The ingredients are of quality, the products work well together. I have since gone back to minoxidil, and once I have stopped the current shedding phase, I may buy another bottle to use as a support product. For that, I give it 4 stars.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I first tried it on the back of my hand and was horrified. The resulting color was orange pink. Then, only because I wanted to thoroughly & accurately test the product for reviewing, I decided to put it on half of my face. I expected to see orange skin like on my hand, but oddly, this just blended into my skin as a VERY CLOSE MATCH. So I put it on the rest, including under my eyes. Not bad. Glad I put it on my face.<br /><br />My skin is fair, pale, with cool undertones. What I think happened is that my hands were much cooler than my face. It is the heat of the skin that triggers the color change. It is winter, and I keep my house cool so naturally my hands were on the cool side. Skin of my face must have been just warm enough for this to work.<br /><br />That being said, the color match is impressive. It comes out in a grayish white cream, then bursts into color, then recedes to a dang close color match. On me, it was just a tiny bit darker & warmer than I would normally go for my ultra pale face. It covered well and did a nice job of evening out my skin tone (I have pink cheeks from ROSACEA- type 1 redness w/ visible veins). It didn't look weird. It goes on like a foundation, so plan to use a mirror to make sure that you are adequately covering your face.<br /><br />I think this is better for those that do not have dry skin. I have dry skin. Even with great products used underneath, I still thought this looked a little patchy on my skin in some spots. No pilling or balling though. Stayed in place for remainder of day. It could be my lack of skill in applying make up (this is an SPF, but it needs to be manipulated like a foundation).<br /><br />Overall, it isn't for me, but it does seem to be a quality product. I find it to be an interesting product and might be worth the try, especially if you want some natural coverage that will even out the skin. It does cover nicely.

{"text": "Interesting product! I have used another rose tinted sunscreen before and was intrigued enough by it to try another. This one might be even better. Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion. But it does a phenomenal job evening out my skin tone.  I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well. Yet even with the clearly pink mask that it gives me, it looks better than pink and red splotches. I just wouldnt go out in public with this alone. SO, this got me thinking about using it as a BASE layer to another sunscreen, mixing it, or the best use.. using it under make up. It will provide a great foundational canvas for a layer of foundation. Wont need to rely on the make up to even things out. If you have splotchiness, you may like trying this out.

{"text": "I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!), and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.<br /><br />Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass, but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean, but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.<br /><br />I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich, super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did, I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here, lol. I kinda want it as a body wash.

These are not fancy soaps. They are small, but they are not necessarily travel sized. They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically, it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.<br /><br />The bars are thin, but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now, and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.<br /><br />The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove, Cinnamon, Oregano, Peppermint, Parsley, Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.<br /><br />It has been an odd, but unexpectedly pleasant product to use.

While topicals won't really help the veins, I can use products that help even out skin tone where it is pink from flushing. Some products can initially make my skin red, then it calms down (especially if new). This ISNTREE Cica Relief Ampoule Duo Set has not irritated my skin. In fact, it has helped to minimize aggravated skin.<br /><br />The serum is extremely light. I think the lightest weight product I have ever used. The bottles are small, and I feel like I am going through it quickly. I may be using too much, I dont know. I  do apply to neck and chest as well as face. I already use a product with EGF (epidermal growth factor), and I thought that maybe in serum form it would feel like a more concentrated dose. I have no idea how much Isntree uses, but this product feels like the emphasis is on the Centella Asiatica Extract. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, I am just not sure yet what I think about the performance of this product for my skin.  The two small bottles would be better as 1 bottle.<br /><br />--super light weight<br />--absorbs instantly<br />--not tacky<br />--skin feels instantly smooth (I also use some on the back of my hands)<br />--I wouldn't use it alone as a moisturizer, especially if have dry skin (like me)<br />--gentle, doesn't aggravate my skin, but that very well could differ for everyone (esp those w/ damaged skin barrier)<br />--contains soothing centella asiatica extract<br />--contains EGF- worth doing some research to see the benefits and to discount myths.<br />--ingredients that can help build and maintain skin barrier. Especially important for those with skin conditions where they are exacerbated by a damaged skin barrier. Got super sensitive skin? work on repairing that skin barrier before anything else.<br />--NO added fragrance in ingredient list. No naturally occurring scent either. I cant detect any aroma.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, smooth and clear (except for visible veins), leans dry. I follow this up with a moisturizing SPF (their sunscreens are great) or a moisturizer if using at night.<br /><br />I dont think it is bad. I really just think it is ok. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. For me it isn't quite a 4 star product, so I am going with the middle of the road rating of 3. Your experience will vary. I think it would be especially appealing to those who prefer a weightless non tacky Centella Asiatica product. While I have zero issues with this, I am not likely to repurchase it. I have preferred products, especially for EGFs. However, if I notice anything else-- good or bad, I will be sure to update. It can take at least 2 weeks for a product to show its effectiveness, and it can take that long for the skin to acclimate to a new product.

The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity, with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense, so after settling, I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal, I am reticent to use in on my face, and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me, and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).<br /><br />Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive, the product smells good, and the ingredients are interesting; highly nourishing & repairing for the skin.

{"text": "The bottle and texture is very much like a hair mousse or shaving cream, but is a wash for the body.  Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream.  The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents.  If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc..  then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care. Fun fact, \"These ingredients are used in cosmetics and personal care products as a replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC propellants, some of which have been shown to have negative effects on the environment\".  I'm not a big fan of slathering my body with butane, propane, or isobutane, but I understand their use in this type of medium. So it's up to you to decide.<br /><br />This company does have non aerosol body wash available too..<br /><br />The resulting foamy wash comes out thick, it is creamy. Because it reminds me so much of a shaving cream, that it what I have been using it for. Then whatever is left over I use on rest of body. Is pleasant smelling enough to me but it isn't quite a pure aromatherapy experience for me. Clearly it uses a variety of essential oils- rosemary, orange, eucalyptus, peppermint, limonene. However, for whatever reason, it contains \"parfum (fragrance)\" as an added ingredient. As well as Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, another synthetic fragrance ingredient. Is there not enough naturally occurring scent from the use of essential oils? I think the added synthetic fragrance is redundant and takes away from the olfactory experience.<br /><br />As an actual wash, it is fine.<br />3 stars-- this is just a middle of the road rating.

{"text": "This Juicy Chemistry face & body scrub is a very mild, and seemingly gentle \"scrub\" chock full of great ingredients. For rating, I am right in the middle of neither really liking it nor really disliking it (ok, maybe leaning a more toward dislike for me). The \"3 stars\" include the fact the company (and their ingredient selections) seems of high quality and may be worthwhile to check out.<br /><br />I have mixed thoughts on this, so please bear with me as I try to explain.<br /><br />At first glance, the small container is packed to the brim with a dark brown, dry, granular looking substance. This is primarily a combo of coffee powder and cocoa powder. I thought it was going to be a rough scrub, and immediately thought that there is no way I would use that on my face. Since it says, \"for face AND body\" my plan changed  to use it on my body in the shower. However, the directions say to apply TO FACE, and allow to sit for 10 minutes/until dry. That isn't happening as a body scrub. In the shower.<br /><br />So now I am back to trying it on my face. It did not come with a spatula or spoon, so plan to use your own. Or scoop out with a finger.I have tried it by spooning out a bit of product and adding water, adding a hydrosol, and adding an oil. The latter makes it easiest to use through I do not know if it impeded the other ingredients. Also, it wouldn't dry with oil. But it did stay in place with oil.<br /><br />Any granular feeling quickly melted down, so I felt better about using it on my face. But still, not a fan of anything granular on face. Overall, I don't like it for my face- I only tried it once because that is all I could handle. . It felt like it left some powder behind. I felt compelled to rewash my face to get any remnants off. Meh.<br /><br />Body is fine (and is why I selected it for use). When used with all bases I mentioned, the result was a slightly oily feel. Not heavy, not greasy. Definitely a little bit of hydration/moisture. Ultimately not a fan of it for my face, but do like it enough for use on body. HOWEVER, I do not \"keep it on until it dries\" while I am using it.. in the shower. I just use it like a regular body scrub. I either add water to it, or oil. OR use a basic creamy body wash as the vehicle. Now that I think of it, even a body lotion would work (especially if you have one you dont love and want to use up). Once again, the oil (or body wash/ lotion) is easier to worth- I can work it all over body, massage it in, and as it rinses away once again that slightly oily feel is left behind (not greasy, not heavy, rather soft and light; rather nice).  Make sure to rinse shower as this will splatter brown all over.<br /><br />I like that the product is packed into a small jar container, and that it needs a base (water, hydrosol, etc) which can be good or bad depending on your preference. By needing to add your own, the product is more concentrated (not paying for added water,etc), but it lends just a tiny bit of inconvenience. Use in the shower is awkward. Use as a scrub mask is going to come down to preference. If you like a more granular feeling physical scrub/exfoliator this may not be for you. If you use more, you may get more of a scrub feel (I guess you could add sugar). I use less as I do not want a harsh physical scrub. For the shower, I prefer a greater scrub feel, so I use more. I am thinking now I may add this to another jar, add some cream or oil, and some added sugar for an easier to use shower scrub experience.<br /><br />Packaging is nice, and pleasant to look at.

So for me, I find that it is almost TOO light for my needs. Here is what I do like: I like that I can easily pair it with other products as it doesn't seem to pill or roll.  I would never use this at night as it is just too light for me, but it has been fine for use in my morning skin care routine- after a serum and before a moisturizing SPF. I don't feel like it works as my only moisturizer, but I DO think it is worth a try. The ingredients are fabulous.  While it doesn't feel like it is drying, it doesn't give me that dewy oomph that my preferred products can provide. Maybe I need to use it for a longer duration (sometimes that happens.. something I use for awhile doesnt seem to be doing anything but I keep using it to use it up, and at some point I notice a noted improvement).<br /><br />Despite it containing a lot of different nourishing oils, I would prefer it to feel and look a little oilier.

Now, using harsh products can contribute to broken skin barrier, but often it is simply environmental or physical (too many exfoliating sessions, too harsh/physical scrubbing, too much sun/wind/vacillating temps). So I consider my skin semi sensitive because I am aware that I used to have really sensitive skin and now I seem to not to, but I still actively regard and address my skin in terms of maintaining skin barrier. THIS product has ingredients that help the skin barrier (NMF, Serine).<br /><br />I like it a lot, good stuff. Definitely recommend.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Interesting array of ingredients. The predominant scent (and minor, initial flavor) is that of seaweed, since that it the primary ingredient. It doesn't come back up in burps like a fish oil can.<br /><br />I have been taking this for 2 weeks now. I did not immediately start with a full 2 caps does as I wanted to make sure that I could tolerate the new ingredients. I can. So then about a week in I began taking two caps. I know I have forgotten a dose or two, but I am through 2 of the six blister packs, and just starting my third. I am embarking on a multi pronged approach to my massive shedding cycles. I used to have incredibly crazy thick hair and over the past 10 years or so, it has greatly reduced. My hair grows fine (it is nearly waist length) but the hairs are thinner, and the overall volume on my scalp has reduced. While we all naturally shed, the amount that comes out when I am in a shedding cycle is depressing. I hope to reduce the frequency and amount of loss. SO, I am taking supplements, starting some new DHT blocking shampoo and conditioner, adding in a scalp treatment.. etc. This supplement is all together different than what I have been taking, so I am extra hopeful for its effectiveness. It am currently either in an \"off shedding cycle\", or my approach is working. I don't want to claim yet that this is working as I think the benchmark for noted improvement is 3 weeks. BUT I'm not too far off, so maybe?! I am keeping track, so I will be back to update as I go. Currently, I feel fine taking this, and it never makes me feel nauseous.<br /><br /> It is a 60 capsule (30 day) supply. Easy to pop out blister packs of 10 capsules, 6 blister packs total in a cardboard container. The pills are a typical sized basic soft capsules that could be opened up and added to food or drink.  Acquired 08/2020, it has expiry date of 02/2021.<br /><br />From my knowledge of Ashwagandha, if you have hyperthyroidism, you may want to avoid this herb, where as if you have hypothyroidism (me!) it can be a helpful herb to use.<br /><br />Suggested daily use: take 2 capsules with a glass of water.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS  1 CAP  2 CAPS<br />-Brown Seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) extract  100 mg  200 mg<br />(increase hair mineralisation, which leads to thicker hair)<br /><br />-Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extract  170 mg  340 mg<br />(improve scalp circulation and strengthen the hair, possibly reverse grays)<br /><br />-Triphala extract*  170 mg  340 mg<br />(repairs damaged hair and increases hair volume)<br />* (Emblica officinalis, Terminalia bellerica, Terminalia chebula, 1:1:1)<br /><br />-Korean Ginseng (Panax ginseng) extract  20 mg  40 mg<br />(strengthens the hair follicles with optimum nutrition, thereby reducing hair fall to a large extent and stimulating healthy hair growth)<br /><br />-Fleeceflower (Fallopia multflora) extract  30 mg  60 mg<br />(helps stimulate the growth stage in hair follicles)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Notes:<br />--Seanergix 4 New Hair is not effective in cases of Male Pattern Baldness (baldness due to generic reasons).<br />-- Not recommended for pregnant women.<br /><br />From their webpage:<br /><br />The combination creates one of the best and strongest Natural products to prevent hair loss and regrowth hair.<br /> --After 3 weeks of using Seanergix 4 New Hair it will be visible that the hair is in process of reduction in hair falling.<br />-- After 3 months of using Seanergix 4 New Hair almost 40% of new/regrowth hair will be seen!!!<br />-- After 6 months of using Seanergix 4 New Hair the reduction in hair loss is almost stopped while the hair growth continues to regrow.<br /><br />This is one of those things that if you see it working, you will want to continue with it. Upfront expectation to really know if it is working seems to be around 3 months-- which would be true of any product of this nature.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />EDIT: Within the one full pack of use (some skipped doses), I can tell there is less hair fall. This makes the first benchmark accurate. \"After 3 weeks of using Seanergix 4 New Hair it will be visible that the hair is in process of reduction in hair falling\". Possible that I was ending a shedding phase, but I have indeed experienced reduced shedding while taking this product.<br /><br />It is because of this that I decided to KEEP GOING with it. Going forward.. For me to be able to tell the second benchmark has been met, \"After 3 months.. almost 40% of new/regrowth.. will be seen\" I will need to continue to buy this.  So I know I will actually need at least 2 more to be able to tell if this second benchmark is accurate. I may be awhile, but I will continue to update. (and of course, if it does actually work, then I will be continuing this for quite some time).", "label": 1}
{"text": "The \"Drop the Bomb\" BBOSONG Suns stick uses one of THEE best UVA/UVB sunscreen ingredients on the planet: \"Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine\"! Say that 5 times fast. Or once. lol. It is a broad spectrum, highly photo stable, chemical sunscreen. Chemical sunscreens mean that they absorb rays and disperse as heat before they can reach skin and do damage. The SPF rating of 50+ and PA++++ means that it offers the highest amount of protection that a sunscreen can offer.<br /><br />Korean skin care, particularly sunscreens, can use super effective ingredients that products made in (or for) USA can not have because the governing bodies have not approved it. It is not because they are unsafe, but because there is a significant amount of bureaucracy involved. No new sunscreen ingredients have been approved in the USA in over 15 years, sad since there are so many wonderful innovations in the rest of the world. We lag greatly behind. Fortunately, we can still buy these products.<br /><br />The other sunscreen used in this product is, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)- a less stellar chemical sunscreen that has mixed thoughts on its efficacy, safety, and desirability. It protects only against UVB rays and breaks down when exposed to light (10% per 30-40 minutes). However, when combined with another broad spectrum sunscreen, it compliments it very well.<br /><br />The third sunscreen component is, Octocrylene.  Screens out the UVB and somewhat in the UVA II range. It is quite photostable (loses 10% of SPF protection in 95 mins) and is often used to stabilize other photo-unstable UV-filters (octinoxate) It is also often used to improve the water resistance of the products.<br /><br />As for all the other ingredients- primarily stabilizers, viscosity controlling ingredients, hardeners-- basically all ingredients that make it a STICK than can glide onto the skin. It is formulated to melt into the skin on contact, and yet absorb thoroughly. Basically, you won't even know it is there.<br /><br />And like so many other Korean skin care items, there are ingredients that go above and beyond the basic sunscreen-- included are skin loving ingredients (emollients, skin conditioners, soothers) such as Japanese knotweed, water lily, gotu kola (centella asiatica), camellia japonica, Lespedeza Capitata Extract (anti inflammatory), scutellaria (ie scullcap/mint), green tea, licorice, rosemary, chamomile<br /><br />Has a super mild scent- clean, fresh almost like a deodorant, but subtle.<br /><br />Happens to be a in a container that reminds me of deodorant. Super small, cute. Stick in a pocket or purse. I happen to love using it on my hands. I am in my 40s, and while I have been using SPF most of my life on my face, I figured it was high time to remember to put some on my hands. I like keeping this in my purse or my car, and applying it when I go to drive. That seems to be the time that my hands are most consistently exposed to the sun. Figure, hands on the steering wheel and in front of a big window. So yeh, this is perfect for that.<br /><br />I have no problem using this on my face.  Doesn't grab skin when used over a moisturizer. If need be can be applied/emulsified in palms then patted on. I prefer it as my \"reapply\" SPF rather than my first application product (I am used to a cream style). When I do apply it to my face, I always run it over my lips. It is very silky, doesnt have a sunscreen flavor or feel, and it is adding much needed hydration and protection from the sun.<br /><br /> Again, I am in my 40s.. clear fair skin but with Rosacea (non acne- just redness and visible veins). Leans dry. Loves Korean skin care.<br /><br />This is so clear, so clean feeling, and so incredibly light that I wish I could show you how it doesn't even feel like anything is on. Not greasy, not even dewy. My skin feels bare.<br /><br />If I have any complaints, it is the use of fragrance. While it smells nice and doesn't really linger.. it would not make a top choice for use on my face. I do however like it for everywhere else and rather enjoy the light scent before it dissipates fully.<br /><br />Even so, it is a really good product, so far. If I experience anything else, I will be back to say so.<br /><br />For all the other ingredients, the each rate 1-2 (very low in terms of hazard to self or environment) on EWG Skin Deep Database.", "label": 1}
{"text": "First one I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to. When I looked at it, I thought I had been bamboozled as it appears to just be an airy dry foam sponge in a tin can. Maybe that is all it is. So I set out to change eye shadow colors, and was floored by how it thoroughly cleaned my brush. What is this sorcery? I don't use too many colors, and I either change brushes or wipe it on a reusable cotton round to clean off one shadow before moving onto next. My brushes always still have a little color on them (whether it be powder or cream). THIS? This took it all off my brush.<br /><br />I still stare at my clean brush in wonderment.<br /><br />Are there better eye shadow switching pans? no idea.

{"text": "I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, \"made for USA but made in China\", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive \"natural, healthy\" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes \"4D silk fiber lashes\", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can glean any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Can't go wrong with Cica cream, and at this price it is a bargain.<br /><br />Cica cream is soothing and hydrating and is especially great if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, \"medium\" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, \"a sun kissed glow\".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the \"medium\" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a \"sun kissed glow\". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy, and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I am a big fan of Neogen products, and Korean beauty products in general. I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn't used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted \"sheet mask\". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn't sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far. It just feels so gentle on my skin!<br /><br />Benefits, and a little more info:<br /><br />--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide double synergy effect for absorbing sebum and removing dead skin cells. The charcoal powder delivers gentle yet effective adsorption benefit to draw impurities, while hypoallergenic peeling essence (Hydroxycinnamic Acid) provides manual exfoliation combined with chemical peeling effect.<br /><br />--Manual exfoliation + chemical peeling effect.<br />--With two sides including Charcoal pad that cleanses the skin and embossing pad that softly purifies the skin.<br /><br />--Pore clarifying: Formulated with natural Peat water and Charcoal powder(310 ppm), these help to draw deep-seated sebum, whiteheads, dead skin cells, and other impurities out of pores for smoother and clearer skin.<br /><br />--Gentle Peeling: NEOGEN PHA\u2122 removes dead skin cells and impurities without irritation or discomfort while leaving the skin radiantly hydrated and smooth.

{"text": "This is my second scrub with this company. The first was great, but I find that the fragrance is too much for me with this Honey one. These products do contain \"parfum\" as an added ingredient, but it is last on the list. I have included a picture of the ingredients as I do not see the list anywhere else. My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like. I have noticed some shea containing products have that, but the other one that I do like has shea as well but isn't cloying. So I don't know. I'm afraid it might trigger a headache for me. I may have to have someone else in the household finish it off. Love the other one I mentioned, though!<br /><br />As for how it works- no problem. A thick frosting like creamy texture with a hint of grit. It does a nice job cleaning, polishing, and leaving the skin feel smooth and moisturized. It is a gentle scrub- very gentle. Definitely softens skin. I scoop out a generous 1/8-1/4 cup amount to use on my body. With that amount, I expect several uses from this squat container. I particularly like this one for my legs and feet as they are the most neglected in terms of skin care.<br /><br />I really do like Natural Soultion salt scrubs, and it appears that there are 4 kinds. This one based solely on the fragrance is a miss for me, but another one happened to be a hit for me, which I will continue to use as needed.<br /><br />EDIT: While a whiff from the container is too strong for me, the actual aroma in the shower continues to be pretty tame. It dawned on me to smell my skin after showering (something I didn't do with prior showers prior to initial review), and my skin doesn't have that strong smell that I note from the container. It smells pleasant and light, and I wanted to come back to say so.SO I just wanted to say that I haven't had a headache, and I don't actually smell like the scent from the container- I was concerned I would have that perfume smell.

{"text": "WOW!! These are good. They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2\". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5\". Many are 1\" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won't lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can't read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I use a larger plug in water flosser unit in my full bathroom (on upper level of house) which has a large capacity water reservoir. I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br /><br />Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (\"anti-fouling rubber stopper\"). It doesn't come attached, and I wish it did since I'd rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it. We'll see.<br /><br />The unit comes with four attachments, all for doing different jobs- so unless someone has a need for this unit and for an attachment for something different than what you need, I would say this is for solo use. Good sized water reservoir, too.<br /><br />Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars. If the nozzles were a little longer, with slightly more curve than it has, I would consider this a perfect product.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I waited a little while after trying out this product to write a review. I was super curious about it, and I was hoping that it was something amazing that I may have overlooked in my skin care routine. I read that it is way more effective than an eyebrow razor. Then I tried it, and it made me laugh. It is not better. I don't want to sound cynical, but I really don't want  you to spend money where you don't have to.  See, Do It Yourself/DIY deplaning is pretty much shaving. Don't let this more expensive \"deplaning tools\" state otherwise. I would either buy any regular shaver of your choice, and/or use one of the smaller eyebrow shaver tools. Check  out Youtube and see all the people using the latter for this purpose. This is NOT salon level. Putting it in a pretty pink box and seeing single blades in an awkward razor handle (sorry, \"WAND\") does not justify expense. Even if it were as cheap as a typical razor, or eyebrow/facial razor, I still would not recommend, which I will get to.<br /><br />If you take a look on Amazon, more and more of the eyebrow/facial razors are coming out, with longer lengths, and with the hot word, \"deplaning\" in the description. Despite the product description/cautionary tale- eyebrow razors are sharp enough, as well as regular razors. Seriously, if you are looking to remove thicker hair or even peach fuzz, one of these cheaper tools will work. This is trying to fit that niche, but with a fancier presentation. Don't fall for it. Schick has regular razors and the small eyebrow/facial razors that will do the job.<br /><br />Why do I say all this? because I shave EVERY day. I use a regular razor (I think 3 blade) on the large parts of my face, and the smaller eyebrow/facial razor (single blade) for smaller areas (thought these areas only need to be attended to once in awhile). I am a female in my 40s and I have been shaving since I was in my teens. I have dark hair and very light skin, with a propensity toward excess hair all over, so any hair on my face stands out. I never cared for that (shocker), and NO, shaving never ever creates more hair, or thicker, or whatever. What shaving (or call it \"deplaning\") does do is clean up the face and exfoliate. Shaving isn't just for guys!<br /><br />Anyway, I used this on one side of my face, and use my other typical tools on the other. I preferred outcome with my typical tools. I tried it over the course of a few days, so I could give it a chance and determine if I learned anything new. But I kept coming back with same result- this is no better, and even less effective than my regular razor and/or little eyebrow facial razor.<br /><br />When I tried this product, I was thinking that maybe I would get an even closer shave. Nope, not even close. I tried it according to the meager directions- use on a dry face. Not impressed. Thinking maybe I could do better with a damp face, I tried that- definitely not. I pulled skin taut, I made sure product was pressed firmly but gently, I tried short strokes, I tried long strokes.. I worked the angle of the razor as recommended, and just found it hindered my sight, and it was hard to tell if I was getting anywhere with it. I went back and tried to research the product, or similar products, I tried to find videos- just nothing that made me think I was at all using it wrong. I am experienced with facial hair removal, and this is not what I will be using.<br /><br />One thing I do kinda like: I like that the handle is trying to make people use it at the correct angle- it takes a little getting used to. There is a tiny bit more fineness required with the small single razor eyebrow/facial razors, but I have never cut myself with one. I did nick myself with this. So maybe the guiding design isn't great, after all?<br /><br />I want to clarify: General information on deplaning says not to use products for a couple of days and to only do this once a month or so. That is really just for professional level deplaning. If you are doing this at home, with what amounts to a regular razor, (no matter the size, or how it is packaged), once can and should use their products as usual, and shaving can be done daily. If you do not have much hair to remove, then just 1-2x a week should suffice. If you are a hairy beast like me, who could easily shave 1-2 times a day, then know that the degree of exfoliation provided in this manner does not require refraining from product use. Though, that is all dependent upon how your individual skin reacts.  Now, if you were getting this professionally done (the tools are different, and does a thorough job), then by all means follow directions of your technician.<br /><br />What's in box: 2 handles, with two razors (ie, \"deplaning blade\") in each handle (ie; \"wand\"). A little brush to clean out hair that will build up. Not extra razors. Not protective cover to keep them sharp. I don't expect them to last long- it is just a single razor, nothing special. The \"wands\" do not appear able to have the razor swapped out. Instructions are same as the \"instructions for use\" listed in this product page. Basically a printed version.<br /><br />Hope this helped. Again, I don't like to be so negative about a product, but this is one that I do not find more effective than what it is trying to replace.", "label": 0}
{"text": "It doesn't perfectly straighten the hair, but it definitely smooths it out, getting it pretty close to straight. The crush style straightener is pretty easy to use. It will take a little getting used to over using a flat plate straightener. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to use it on my long, thick, wavy hair.. but I had no trouble with it. My first time using it was on not freshly washed hair- maybe a day or two after last shampoo. I used a little thermal protector, and then started swiping the brush through my hair. It took longer than using a flat plate to get hair smoothed out, but I do like the natural looking results. I like the ability to use a fine water mist- this helps to smooth out the hair.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Jade roller and jade scraper comes in pleasant looking box with a small bag to store these items in. It would make for a nice gift. Product claims to be made of real jade, which I looked for in making my decision.<br /><br />The jade roller feels good on the face, especially when first being used due to the coolness of the stone. I wouldn't normally buy something like this, but I already massage my face a little every day (fluid build up), so I thought this would be an interesting way to change things up.<br /><br />Again, I love the feel of the cool stone rolling across my face. I have rosacea and it just feels so comforting on my reddened skin. I haven't been real consistent with its use so I can not attest to how effective it is in terms of benefits to the skin. It does provide a gentle massage, which is good for draining lymph nodes and helping to reduce swelling. I am using it before I put on moisturizers, etc, as per recommendation on instructions. It says using this before hand will help the products work better. In my 40s with barely emerging fine lines, I am all for doing what I can to keep those at bay.<br /><br />As I learn anything new, I will add to my review.", "label": 1}

{"text": "[[VIDEOID:7cfc995b010d23bc7176b91f843fecfa]] Hotep and party on brothers and sisters and thank you for looking at my review of the HMPRT 80s 90s Costume, A Black Mullet Rocker Wig and Wig Cap, Black T-Shirt, Wayne\u2019s World Baseball Cap, and Inflatable Guitar. What I like about this set it's a spoof of Wayne's World and it comes with a Wayne's World cap, a wig, T shirt and an inflatable guitar. The inflatable guitar gives a whole new meaning to the term air guitar. With this you can play Bohemian Rhapsody! \u201cNOT\u201d Long live, Queen.<br />\u201cWayne's World\" was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled \"Wayne's Power Minute\" (1987) on the CBC Television series It's Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. A prototype of the Wayne character had appeared several years prior on CITY-TV in Toronto's overnight show City Limits. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned a hit 1992 film, its 1993 sequel, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon. The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers, the same actor from \"Wayne's Power Minute\"), an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show \"live\" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30. The first \"Wayne's World\" sketch appeared in the 13th Saturday Night Live episode of the 1988/1989 season. The only thing I didn't like about the Cap is that it clearly looks like a woven Cap on the ad, but the Cap that I was sent is definitely a screen print which I guess is, OK?  \u201d NOT\u201d.

It has a really awesome design, a very nice weight so that it stays in the hand and also can be used to clean out from under the nails too.<br /><br />I really do love using this though. I always give it a little wipe with an alcohol pad and then do what I need to do. I use the curved ended down to push my cuticles back and then use it face up to clean out from under my nails, because lets face it. It doesn't matter what you do, stuff is still gonna get up in there and you have to clean it out every so often.<br /><br />Anyway, works great and totally worth the price.

I used it just like the instructions said and it smoothed out the small lines at the corner of my eyes and under the eyes. It completely reduced the size of my pores on my nose, which are usually very large. I mean, it made my face look great but the real test was how did my make up look over this stuff.

{"text": "I am happy with my order of the Resin Decorative Accessories Set. This was packaged well and arrived in great condition. What I really like is that this set of tools and inclusions comes in a multi-level box that is transparent. It is easy to see what inclusions are inside, which is very easy to use while working on a project. Pipettes are really great to remove bubbles and also to apply very small amounts of resin into detailed areas. The silicone mat is essential to protect a working surface and the tweezers are very useful to add small items into a poured resin piece. There are also extra 30ml mixing cups, tiny spoons and wooden sticks.<br /><br />These inclusions are great to use with other materials besides resin like nail art, decoupage glues, acrylic paint and polymer clay. This makes the set versatile for working with different mediums and for different projects. There are full round hole-less beads and also half beads. I really like the tiny seashells, my set also includes a tiny starfish. I am putting these into a resin painting with some sand I saved from a recent beach vacation. The only thing included with this set that is not useful to me are the finger cots, as I prefer to wear gloves when working with resin. The only negative aspect is very small, but some glitter was loose. I did not find this to be bothersome, but did want to mention that. There is a lot of supplies in this kit and I consider it to be a really great value for all that is included. I hope that my experience is helpful as you kindly click the button below.", "label": 1}

I find that this is a good nail drill for personal use, but I wouldn't recommend it for multiple users as it does start to get warm in my hand when I am finishing on myself.

{"text": "There are pros and cons to the Tirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack. I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing. I hope you find my experience helpful and kindly will click the button below.", "label": 1}

I have no strong opinion about the pads or scrapers. Overall, this is not a product I would recommend, but if you are after the accessories in the kit, then I would say this is a decent kit to have those on hand.

All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!  Also, this razor doesn't give me razor burn like my Brauns did!!<br /><br />If you are a first time shaver, or an expierenced shaver looking for a better shave from an electric razor, this is the one for you!

{"text": "The key to having a tattoo that both lasts and looks great for the long term is how it\u2019s cared for during the initial healing process - and this product is perfect to aide in the healing and aftercare.<br /><br />This moisturizing tattoo lotion is the perfect product to use after cleaning your tattoo. This lotion is excellent at hydrating the skin and holding the moisture without being overly greasy as many of other products tend to be.<br /><br />This lotion is far cheaper than many other similar products but I found the quality superb.  This lotion is much cheaper than what you\u2019ll find at many tattoo studios but every bit as good.<br /><br />Having a vibrant, great looking tattoo requires properly caring for it through the healing process and after. This lotion is all you need to help your piece of art look great for a lifetime.<br /><br />You\u2019ll never regret this purchase.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The science behind facial skincare has made many discoveries over the last decade and in turn the best skincare products have evolved to take advantage of those findings.<br /><br />This Sunrise Serum by Merlot  is a perfect example of one of these products. Collagen is key to healthy, youthful looking skin - certain ingredients have been found to promote collagen production. This product incorporates the best ingredients known to increase collagen in facial tissue.<br /><br />In addition this Sunrise Serum has lightening agents that work together to smooth and even skin tone.  I was especially interested in this aspect as I have a few sunspots that I want to lighten.  Over the several weeks of using this twice a day I can see that it is gradually lightening them. Obviously, I understand any treatment such as this, requires extended daily use to achieve the results I\u2019m seeking, but based on my initial findings I\u2019m confident it will work.<br /><br />This is an excellent product that I absolutely recommend. I look forward to using more Merlot products in the future as I found this serum superb.", "label": 1}

Buildable color if you want a more intense look. You can use both colors together, which is what I do. I am medium complexion, blonde, 48 years old.

When you apply the magnetic eyeliner, you have to be precise. The eyeliner is black, and will look very dark if you do too thick of a line. I would do thinner lines if possible, with about 2 layers so that the eyeliner is not overwhelming. Once the eyeliner dries, use the application tool to put the lashes on.<br /><br />It does feel a bit strange at first (if false lashes are new to you), and it may tickle around your eyes when you blink. But yes, these really work! With more practice my wife will get better at this.<br /><br />The only thing is that the magnetic eyeliner does not come off easily.

I can only recommend this one since it seems to help reduce under eye puffiness, not so much the dark circles though but I do like how my skin looks overall.", "label": 1}

For some reason these just really work for my hair.<br /><br />This one is a travel sized conditioner for fine, thin or flat hair and my hair really takes to it. I find it sad though that for this little one they are charging so much. You are much better of getting the regular size and putting that in a travel size container yourself.<br /><br />The conditioner itself smells amazing and I for one really love that. It is smooth and I let it usually work on my hair for like 3 to 5 minutes. The conditioner rinses out with ease and leaves my hair nice and soft. I find that my hair looks fantastic. It is nice and shiny, and it definitely gets a boost in volume, and just has a healthy look and feel to it.", "label": 1}

The lotion is creamy but lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin making my skin feel soft and hydrated. Very happy and for that price there really are no complaints.", "label": 1}

I have a couple who don't but this one does and it is not a big deal since you apply it before you head to bed. The next morning you will love the results.

It has a low molecular hyaluronic acid which helps adding moisture to the skin and is meant for daily treatment of your face.<br /><br />It has a mild fragrance only and is nice and fresh. I for one do like it quite a bit. This is more like a toner and you use it quite similarly to one. Pour some of it on a cotton pad and gently pad the essence onto your skin until it is fully absorbed.<br /><br />I find it absorbs quickly into the skin. It feels a tad sticky at first but that quickly goes away. My skin does feel nicely moisturized when I use this so I do like this quite a bit. This is a lovely product.", "label": 1}

It is also vegan and plant based which is great. It produces a nice gentle lather that works well and I found I don't need much when I  use it. They made sure that it maintains the natural pH of the skin so you are not prone to infections.<br /><br />The fragrance is ok in my eyes and it works well overall. The price is a bit on the more expensive side considering how much product you get, however considering that it is vegan and all, I think it kind of makes up for it. I am not upset with this product and mine was not expired yet but close, but these types of products can be used at least 3 years past that date so I have no issues with that as well.", "label": 1}

You also get a multi-care massage applicator that has red light to treat your skin.<br /><br />The cream itself has a lovely fragrance that I really like. It is creamy yet lightweight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. You can then use the multi-care massage applicator and use it to massage the cream into the skin as a special treat really but it also just works the cream better into the skin. Work the cream from the center to the outside and massage for about 3 minutes. Then make sure to clean the applicator.<br /><br />I have to say this is a special way to apply your cream and makes it more like a spa treatment than anything else and really works quite well. The cream has a lot of good ingredients and together this is fantastic. I for one love this and can only recommend it. When you are out of cream you can just get the refill pack without the massager which is great. The price for this was very reasonable as well.

This clay mask really cleans my skin beautifully and does not dry it out too much. I have normal skin and it does dry it out a little bit but since I always use a good moisturizer afterwards it is not a big deal.<br /><br />Make sure you follow the instruction, clean your face, apply an even layer and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes.

I love using this especially on a hot summer day because it is very refreshing. It is even better yet if you put the cream in the fridge to cool it down, because it feels even more refreshing.<br /><br />This cream absorbs really quickly into the skin. It has a fantastic fragrance of lavender that I am a huge fan of. It is fantastic especially in the evening because it just has a very calming effect on top of the refreshing feel of it. It leaves a slight tack residue on the skin but that goes away in about 5 to 10 minutes, so no big deal. I for one really like this one and it hits every aspect that it should.

I do like how soothing these are and use them when my under eye area is puffy or is very dark and seems like I have been put through the ringer.

It has different sized heads that allow you to change the pressure that you are applying. The power button turns it on and off but also changes the modes from soft to normal to strong.<br /><br />Make sure you keep it moving or the vacuum can actually cause damage, meaning break some capillaries which will cause a bruise. This will obviously heal but who wants a bruise in the face?<br /><br />I really like this because you can really see what is going on up close. It is easy to use and works well.

There is definitely a slight learning curve but watch the video and off you go.<br /><br />The temperature adjustment is at the handle and is very easy to use by rotating it. The tip is insulated so you can actually touch it which is a nice added touch in my eyes. There is also an adjustment that lets you switch if it turns left or right when making the curls so you can switch that as well depending on which way you want your curls to go. It comes with 3 different barrels that lets you change the type of curls you get.<br /><br />I found it works quite well and is easy to use.

With the heat of your skin it also starts to liquify somewhat and makes it easier to apply to your skin.<br /><br />At this point it absorbs pretty easily and quickly into the skin. There were no issues there at all. I for one really liked this cream and it absorbs fully without leaving any residue behind on the skin.

The under eye cream smells ok, somewhat medicinal, herbal, not bad but not the best either but I can handle it.<br /><br />You use those eye rollers to massage it into the skin which is neat and I personally like it since it does help firming the skin. I prefer to put it into the fridge prior to using it since the cooling helps even more, at least I found it does in my case. This cream absorbs quickly, I do use my fingers in the end to make sure everything is fully absorbed, but it does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin. This stays for some time so I would recommend using this in the evening because of that.<br /><br />All in all this is a very nice product.

I like that it comes in a convenient pump dispenser bottle but that and the price are about all I like about this product.<br /><br />The body wash smells horrible and I found it really doesn\u2019t cleanses at all. I actually had a lipstick stain on the back of my hand that I wanted to get rid of and it could NOT get rid of it, like come one really? I don\u2019t think getting rid of a lipstick is that difficult, any kind of soap or cream based product can do it but this body wash could not.

This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils.

Taking a leave-in conditioner out of a jar is a bit of a challenge to be honest. Doing a pump or two is just so much easier.

It has a very mild and very pleasant fragrance that I really like a lot. It lingers for a bit and I wish it would linger a lot longer than it does to be honest. I can\u2019t figure out what it smells like but I really like the mix of it. This contains retinyl palmitate, related to retinol. Remember, whenever you use retinol you want to make sure to protect your skin from the sun since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. However retinol is very good for your skin.<br /><br />This face oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave your skin slightly oily but to me that is ok since I am using a face oil. I prefer to use this at night for two reasons, one because my face is a bit oily for a while when using it and also because retinol containing products do make your skin more sensitive to the sun. When I use this product my skin feels always super soft and smooth and looks nicely moisturized. There are little specs in it that look like gold and I am not sure if it is that or something else but when I use this facial oil my skin has this natural glow to it that I really like.

{"text": "This intensive moisturizer by Easydew is a very nice cream and runs you $45. I would still consider this a mid-range priced product for the quantity you are getting. It comes in a simplistic looking squeeze tube, that almost looks medicinal in my eyes.<br /><br />The cream has a very pleasant fragrance that I personally really like. The cream itself is a medium weight in my eyes and does take a little bit to absorb into the skin fully. It does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin that takes some time to fully disappear. Because of this I would recommend this as an evening cream because you wouldn\u2019t want to apply foundation over it, nor would you want to wear a face mask all day while having that on your skin. I found that products like this make me sweat quite heavily under face masks.<br /><br />I use this in the evenings and do find that in the morning my skin looks nicely moisturized, is soft and smooth. So it does look exactly as I would expect it to with this kind of product. To achieve all this you really don\u2019t need that much of the product either which is great because it is not the cheapest product, however also not the most expensive either. All in all I do really like this but only like using this in the evening.", "label": 1}

The cream is very lightweight. That tip allows precise spot application to where you want and need to put it and allows small application of the product.

It leaves some residue on the skin. That residue does go away within I would say 15 minutes or so.

The scent leaves pretty quickly though.<br /><br />My skin feels nicely moisturized but I didn\u2019t feel like it really did much for wrinkles to be honest.

It produced a decent lather and rinsed out with ease. The conditioner had a similar fragrance in line with the shampoo. It was nice and soft and I did leave it in my hair for about 3 minutes I would say. It was easy to rinse out and left no residue on my hair.

You will first notice the pleasant scent, the reason I ordered this in the first place. I have a serum by Abib that I love and has an incredible fragrance so I figured this one has to be a great product. This mask feels kind of weird on your face because of the cream. It reminds me a bit of nivea cream to be honest, fragrance wise and thickness / consistency wise. So after the 20 minutes are up you take it off and realize there is still a lot of cream on your face. So you gently massage it into your skin. My face felt a bit sticky from all that extra cream to be honest. After about 20 minutes or so that feeling did start to fade, that is just how long it took for all of it to absorb. This is one rich cream I tell you.  My face was nicely moisturized though and it definitely had a bit of a glow from all that cream to it to be honest.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice mask, but maybe a bit too rich for me. I think this would do wonders when your skin is super dry, like on a horrible winter day when you have been outside in the wind all day and your skin is almost peeling off from the cold dry wind. This would restore it back to health. Right now my skin is just a bit too healthy I would say and this one would just be so much better when my skin is in dire need.", "label": 1}

They are fairly cheap but again, getting 12 lipsticks for $10 I don\u2019t have high expectations.<br /><br />I found there is some range in colors but not a big one. There are some darker colors and some lighter colors and then the rest all was somewhat similar. I was a bit disappointed by the colors really, but then again, for the price can I really say anything about that? There weren\u2019t really any nudes in there.<br /><br />The lipsticks were easy to apply but not that creamy. However they feel ok on the lips. They are not very sticky or anything but also don\u2019t feel super smooth or creamy on the lips either. They feel just ok really. They don\u2019t taste or smell of anything. Their staying power is ok, they wear off as you eat and drink like a lot of lipsticks do really. So considering these costs $10 for 12 of them, they are not horrible. They feel ok on the lips, the color range is limited in my eyes but they are not bad at all, all considering. Keeping everything in mind, I am rating them at 3 stars.", "label": 1}

It has a very oriental kind of scent though and I do really like it, ask LouLou, since it is standing right next to it on my perfume shelf. I figured that was the proper space for it.

So to keep the comparison going, at the same volume it is cheaper than LouLou but if you get the 2.7 Fl Oz you pay the same price as you would for the 1.7 Fl Oz for LouLou so you could get a better deal but even though they are similar there are just different enough that I can smell the difference if I do a blind test.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a nice facial creme. It does come in a jar which is not my favorite container for facial product because it is not the most hygienic but you can make it work.<br /><br />The cream itself has a nice scent to it that I do like but it does not linger at all. The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. I found that my face had a slight residue but after about 10 minutes that did fade away and I was left with nice and soft skin.<br /><br />As I said I like this facial skin overall and I had no reactions to it. I have normal skin and don't expect any issues in general though. It is a bit expensive and for that I would have expected a slightly better container than this cheap plastic it comes in.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. I know Argan oil is not cheap but this does seem a bit overpriced. I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my skin feel a lot better to be honest and give it an amazing smell to boot. So keeping all this in mind I find this just around average.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a pretty nice mascara. It comes in a very nice container that looks great. The wand is a very thin and long wand that makes it easy to apply this mascara to your eye lashes.<br /><br />When you apply this mascara make sure you let it dry properly. Once it is dry, it is definitely smudge and waterproof, no doubt about it but until then you can create a mess if you are not careful.<br /><br />I found that I didn't necessarily get thicker eye lashes when I used them but they definitely looked longer. There was no clumping or flaking which was good. I had no negative reaction to this mascara and my eyes were happy. All in all this is a good one, great for length but no real improvement in regards to thickness.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I have pretty long hair and most people with long hair know the issue with split ends. Last year when I was at the hair dresser I mentioned that and the hair dresser stated that the best scrunchie are these little spiral hair ties that are popping up recently. They supposedly don't cause split ends and hair breakage. I figured why not give them a shot.<br /><br />These hair ties will not get soaked if you go for a swim, obviously, which is great. I did notice however that when you just pull it out of your hair you will end up pulling out some hair. I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are a gorgeous minty green. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $13 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten to date so not sure if that is worth it but these are nice and sturdy and made well.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a fantastic cleanser by Higher Education. It comes in a very nice squeeze tube that is nice and simple but has a very clean design in line with this product line. The cleanser smells fantastic very refreshing and really amazing, one of my favorites that I have.<br /><br />The cleanser does not produce a heavy lather but I don't really need that. It feels very nice on the face and cleanses gently away anything from your face. It then rinses of nice and easy and you don't have to keep going over it over and over again like some cleansers which is nice.<br /><br />When you are done your face doesn't feel like you have stripped it of all its moisture which is great. It actually still feels pretty moisturized. I still follow it up with my standard moisturizing routine but I didn't feel it was really necessary which was nice so if you forgot your face won't be hurting for it. This is a fantastic cleanser that feels great on the skin and smells amazing, everything I look for in a daily moisturizer especially since it didn't strip my face of its moisture.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I just love these Sigma Lipsticks! In this set you get 4 unique lipsticks that are all in the same color family but the colors are different enough that you actually get 4 different lipsticks and it is worth getting this set for a whopping $75! The colors are 2 beautiful earthy nudes, one more pinky nude and one stunning red tone that is just plain perfect! This is a gorgeous set in regards to colors.<br /><br />Now the applicators are so unique and different and stunning on their own. They also have a magnetic closure of sorts because when you close them they kind of pull shut at the very end so they must have a magnetic closure in it.<br /><br />The lipstick themselves are super creamy and feel amazing on the lips. They have a pleasant taste to them and are just amazing. There is nothing but greatness about them and these are worthy of the name Sigma! I love everything about these and can only recommend this set. Perfect to give as a gift or purchase and breakup and give individual ones as a gift since each are packaged in a box.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is an interesting concept. You get 15 bubble pads in this container. Each pad is dry though when you get them. You can actually slip your fingers into the pad which makes it easier to use these pads. With these pads you can exfoliate so that is in theory nice but I found in execution it just didn't work as well. The pads didn't have a pleasant scent, well they were actually rather scentless so to me that was rather boring.<br /><br />So when you use them you wet the pads and then clean your face with them. I found that there wasn't as many bubbles as I would have expected from a \"bubble pad\" so that to me was disappointing. They overall cleaned my face ok and I found they didn't dry out my face too much. All in all these worked ok but I wasn't too impressed. You can get a bottle of a nice cleanser for the same price or maybe more but that will last you a lot more than just 15 applications! so to me this is way overpriced and a bit of a waste to be honest.", "label": 0}

This gold digger moisturizer smells amazing and I can't really figure out what it is, but it is the mix of cucumber and melon which is always a winning combination. It contains collagen and hyaluronic acid which are fantastic ingredients for your skin.<br /><br />The cream is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. It leaves no residue behind, just soft and smooth skin that looks and feels great. You don't need a lot of this moisturizers so this jar should last you a good while. So even though it is not the cheapest cream around you still get your money's worth. I like this one, quite a bit and can only recommend it.", "label": 1}

One word of caution, please keep in mind when you use products containing retinol to use sun blocker and to apply them in the evening since these can make your skin sensitive to sun light.<br /><br />This serum comes in a stunning little plastic squeeze tube looking like upside down pump dispenser. It has a pleasant and mild scent that I really like.<br /><br />The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. There is some residue for a brief while but that goes away pretty quickly. It leaves you with nice soft skin that is smooth and feels great. All in all I really do like this even though it is a bit more on the expensive side for what you get. My skin does like it though and with the lower concentration of the retinol this may work better for people who are more sensitive to retinol.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a nice little eye shadow palette that contains 16 eye shadows. The palette is actually pretty small but I have yet to use up a palette to be honest so this one will still take a while. You get 5 very nice mattes that are very pigmented and blend out nicely. With those you can create very nice base looks. Then you can use the 11 different shimmers to change the looks as you please. Anything from creamy lights to golds to purples. There is a very wide variety that allows you to really change up the look.<br /><br />I made some looks without eye primers and the look lasted all day without any issue. So for paying less than $10 this palette is well worth it in my eyes.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I am so torn about this oil. It comes in a glass dropper bottle like most oils come, mostly to protect the oil. Make sure you mix it well since the gold settles on the bottom of it, yes it has actual gold flecks in it. Besides the actual 24k gold it has all natural ingredients making this an actual edible oil. You can use this on its own or mix it with your moisturizer or foundation if you want.<br /><br />So this is a high quality product and worth every penny in my eyes. When you use it you will notice the strong essential oil scent and this is why I am torn. It is just a bi too almost medicinal to me. It is a scent that in my eyes should be in a massage parlor in the essential oil diffuser healing you of something. So for me it was just rather strong but thankfully it does not longer on your face too long.<br /><br />The oil is not too thick and absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. It leaves a slight oily residue on your face and I don't fault it for that since it is an oil. However, if you give it about 10 minutes or so, that oily residue disappears and you feel just soft and smooth skin. Absolutely amazing in my eyes. I love how my face felt when I used that to be honest and was a bit shocked.<br /><br />So I love how it makes my face feel and look, I just need to get over the scent but since you really don't smell it on your face for long I think I can handle it.", "label": 1}

They are very nice colors and all go very well together so you really don't have to think hard to get a look that looks fantastic with this 4 color palette. The mattes blend easily and look great. Even a beginner should have no issue with these. I used them with and without a primer and they had fantastic staying power so no complaints there either.<br /><br />The shimmer and glitter were fantastic to make the look standout. Either one works for whatever occasion you have in mind, shimmer for day to day wear and glitter for a more evening wear in my eyes.<br /><br />At almost $30 for 4 colors this is a bit more on the expensive side since I have gotten some fantastic inexpensive palettes for less with a lot more colors but this is a very nice palette and great for travel really.", "label": 1}

The emulsion smells incredible and is one of my favorites really. It is super lightweight and feels very cooling when you use it so I really like to use this one when I saw a lot of sun during the day because it just feels fantastic and on top of that also smells great.<br /><br />The emulsion absorbs very quickly into your skin and your skin feels amazingly soft. I found my skin looked great as well so this one in my eyes really ticked all the boxes. I felt there was no residue left on my skin either. I for one am a fan and can only recommend this one and the price is not bad at all at less than $30. I might have to check into more of their products. Thankfully it came with lots of samples that I will try and probably end up getting more, oh the hardship.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I really wanted to like this face moisturizer since I prefer using a tinted moisturizer over a foundation every day and this one on top of it also has an SPF 31 to protect your face from the sun. So to me that would be a win win situation.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works very well. Unfortunately that is where the positive really stops in my eyes. The moisturizer is not too thick and almost runny but it isn't. It is very tinted so it kept up on that promise. I did NOT like the smell of it at all and that scent actually does linger while you apply it and some time after so that was definitely a bit no no in my eyes.<br /><br />The applying of the moisturizer was not very pleasant since it was very sticky in my eyes. Distributing it evenly on my face took some actual work and I just didn't like that. IT was not like most moisturizers that just get nicely soaked up by your skin but because of its sticky consistency, which actually reminded me of a foundation, it took a bit. My skin also didn't feel great afterwards and I almost felt like I needed to set it with a setting powder like you would with a foundation. The color of it was also a bit off, some ashen yellowish brown that I found was not very flattering but thankfully it did not add a lot of color to my skin but actually blended into my skin after a little bit and you hardly noticed you added a tinted moisturizer.<br /><br />At least while I was out and about my face was protected from the sun and I did not get sun burnt, so that was the other upside of this moisturizer. But all in all I did not care for the scent of it, the stickiness during application and that it left behind and how it really made my skin look. To me this is more a fail than anything else really.", "label": 0}
{"text": "The Iryasa Face Cream comes in a little jar, which is not my favorite container since you obviously dip into it all the time. So I tend to wash my hands before I do that so I don't introduce dirt and such into it because that can shorten the life span of these products.<br /><br />The cream itself is actually a little heavy which was surprising since it looked light and airy. It has some nice natural ingredients in it which is great. I wasn't too crazy about the smell of it though but that is because it used Geranium essential oil, which is probably one of my least favorite but I was hoping that the lemon would help cover it but it still powered through a lot.<br /><br />The cream absorbs fairly quickly into your skin and but leaves a sticky residue on your skin that doesn't seem to fade for quite some time. Thankfully by using this at night you won't know since you add this last thing before you go to bed and then just fall asleep. It does add moisture to your skin so in the morning your skin does feel pretty nice.", "label": 1}

I don't like to wear foundation every day but instead like to wear tinted kind of products on occasion, just a little bit of something. This one is along those lines just a step back I think since it only adds a bit of glow really while giving a lot of moisture to your skin which it really needs right now. With wearing masks a lot my face is suffering and this really helps countering those effects.<br /><br />This moisturizer comes in a cute little squeeze tube that I do like.

It is a quite oily though and takes quite some time to absorb into your skin. But you can expect that from a face oil if you ask me. Unlike another oil from Lua this one stays oily though, not sure why that is. Because of the oil your face is soft though but that is mostly because of that greasiness. Probably after about an hour or two that goes away and your skin is nice and soft.", "label": 1}

They smell REALLY nice however, a nice gentle floral with some other tones mixed in, very nice. You use these for about 15 to 20 minutes or so and gently rub the remainder of the mask into your skin.<br /><br />When I was done my skin felt pretty soft over. This mask is nice but it is not my favorite. My skin also had a nice residual scent left from the mask which I did enjoy.

It has step by step instructions that are easy to follow and you end up with great looking nails. It actually doesn't take too long either since you can cure 4 nails at a time in the UV lamp except the thumps. So far I have only used the gray and really like that color a lot.<br /><br />Now what I really wish is that they have an adjunt kit where you can order more colors to go with the kit to mix it up some. Just having pink and gray is not enough in my eyes and let's face it having more options would be great where you could pick and choose other colors.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can just peel off the nail polish when you are done instead of having to use harsh chemicals to remove it. I always hated that part and that was one reason why I don't often use nail polish, that and the fact that regular nail polish is pretty damaging to your nails.

The downside with it however is it leaves your skin tacky and that feeling fades but never really fully goes away. There is always a bit of that tacky residue on your skin. I did not notice any significant brightening effects either so it did not come through on that promise either.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok to be honest. I didn't really like how my face felt and it didn't really brighten it either. It does have some ingredients that are good for my face so at least it does some good things for my face even if I don't necessarily like how it feels when it is on, but you can always put another moisturizer on.", "label": 1}

It produces a nice lather that rinses out easily. What I do not like is the fact that it has silicone in it.<br /><br />The conditioner in my eyes is much nicer. The big problem is, the pump dispenser does not work. The conditioner is just too thick and can not be pumped up for some reason. So the suggestion of another reviewer to switch the lids is not a bad one. The conditioner smells much nicer than the shampoo and produces a very nice soft feel on your hair while still wet. It also rinses out nicely.<br /><br />When your hair is dry it does look and feel very nice. So in combination your hair does look nice when you use this combination, just not sure I am a huge fan of the shampoo in this set.

With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is.

{"text": "In today's age when you are restricted with how much liquids you can bring along on your travels on an airplane, it makes sense to fill these little refillable atomizer bottles with your favorite perfume to bring along so you can have them in your carry on luggage. Some times you don't even have a checked in luggage so this is important.<br /><br />I like that in this pack you get 5 different ones. You can dedicate each one to a different perfume so you can bring different ones on your travel. These work very well and you can bring enough on your travels for at least a week plus. They are easy to fill and use and work very well. These are on the cheaper side but for what they are intended these work perfectly well.", "label": 1}
{"text": "You get a lot of hyaluronic acid serum in this bottle. It is pretty much scent less for those who prefer that this one is perfect in that regards. There were no hints of thyme, so not sure if it should smell of it since it is in their name? It feels very tacky on your skin when you apply it and stays that way for a few minutes. So it does take a few minutes to fully absorb into your skin. Your skin feels pretty soft after that, not the softest I have experienced but not bad overall.<br /><br />They recommend to rub it in until it is absorbed, that is a bit tough since it is so sticky. All in all not a bad product but definitely not my favorite.<br /><br />Someone did make a good point about this coming in a plastic bottle. I ended up looking it up and it does have a fairly low pH. That does make me wonder what it does to that plastic bottle and if over time it will dissolve that plastic bottle.", "label": 1}
{"text": "These reusable makeup remover pads environmentally friendly since you can wash them and reuse them which I prefer, which is awesome. Plus they are just so much nicer on your skin. It comes with 16 bamboo/cotton pads and 5x bamboo/cotton/charcoal pads. These are super soft and for sensitive areas. You also get a little mesh pouch where you can store these pads in and also wash them in the washer. This way you won't loose them. It seems they really thought of everything you could possible need! I have been looking for something like these for some time and this is the perfect set. I wish they would have just made all in darker colors so they don't show the makeup stains at all but it is ok the way it is and I can work with it. Fantastic buy of a high quality product!", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a gentle facial cleanser that works very well. It doesn't have a pleasant scent I enjoy but it is not horrible. My skin did feel a bit dry after I used this though and I would have wished it would be more hydrating as they promised. I had to follow it up with a nice moisturizer to make sure my skin didn't dry out too much when I use this cleanser. In my eyes this cleanser is just ok. I was a bit disappointed by the entire line to be honest. It is a bit on the more expensive side with all their products being at least $34 and up. Some of them are on the even more expensive side in my eyes for what you get. They do tend to fall short on the fragrance side across the board.<br /><br />This line is just not for me and did not perform well for me overall. This cleanser did not hydrate but it did cleanse well and was gentle, so at least it performed along those lines. So for that I gave it a 3 star rating.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a very nice mascara. It does come however in a cheaper looking container I think, at least to me the cartoonish container looks cheaper. I didn't think it really added that much volume to my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. It added a good amount of length to be honest and did add a little bit of volume though. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness but then you would get that spidery look that I do not care for.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />This is a nice mascara and it will cost you $18. I have some others that perform similarly that are cheaper than this one though so it is a bit overpriced in my eyes.", "label": 1}

This is really a little power house.<br /><br />Both are on the lighter side and absorb quickly into your skin. Your skin looks and feels great when you use these.

{"text": "This is a very nice hand care bundle for very hands on people. First you get a very nice hand cleaner that contains activated charcoal. This detoxes and cleans very nicely of the toughest dirt, eliminating strong odor but doesn't damage your hands like some strong cleaners might do.<br /><br />Next you get a moisturizing and healing cream. This is great for those who have done some damage to their hands in some physical hand jobs where they hand up with dry and cracked hands. This gives back some moisture and heals those hands.<br /><br />Last but not least is a nice protect and moisturizer. This adds a nice barrier to your hands but also adds much needed hydration to much abused hands that are dry, cracked and scaly. When you have this on your hands it is much easy to wash and wipe away stubborn dirt.<br /><br />This is a nice little set that can also be gifted, especially for people who work with their hands like mechanics or wood workers but many others. This works really well and will help restore some of those much abused hands.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is now the third product from Taya I have tried out, and I have to say this line does not dissappoint. This is probably the most fancy dispenser I have had to date and the most fancy looking bottle. The shampoo is this super creamy, beautiful creamy shampoo. It does not produce a massive lather but to cleanse your hair that is not necessary. You will also notice the incredible smell it has. The conditioner smells the same. I have a body spray that it reminds me off and it is just incredible.<br /><br />This set is a bit on the more expensive side but my hair does look, feel and smell amazing when I use it, so I use this on my splurge and pamper days. They do make some claims for anti breakage and some ingredients that supposedly help with that. I can't really confirm those claims but I do really like this set a lot. It also comes in this unique bottle with an interesting dispensing mechanism and unlike some I had no issues with it whatsoever.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This hydrating cream by Sustainable Youth is one of their better products in my eyes. It is a pretty heavy cream but it does absorb fairly quickly and fully into your skin. It smells heavily of citrus, so finally one of their products actually smells good. Most of their products I have tried to date either don't have a scent or smell kind of bad. Considering how expensive they are in general that is just not acceptable in my eyes. Thankfully this one actually smells pretty good since it is also pretty expensive.<br /><br />This heavier cream actually leaves behind very soft skin that looks good. I liked how my skin felt. The scent of it does dissipate fairly quickly though but that is ok. All in all this is probably my favorite product in their line. Would I repurchase, probably not because their are products out there as good and better for a similar price or cheaper. But from this line this is their best product in my opinion.", "label": 1}

It is a pretty decent size that allows you to bring all your makeup on your travels.<br /><br />It came with some beauty blenders that are pretty good. The makeup brushes that came with it however are just plain cheap and in my opinion crap. You can make them work but I personally don't care for them and have better ones, so there is just no time I will really use them. Plus the weird handle they have really doesn't make them very user friendly either. These are just a waste in my eyes and not sure why they even bothered with them.<br /><br />The bag itself however is gorgeous and a win.

This one is similar to another one I have. Just like with other ones with a lazy Susan the shelves are adjustable which is great since you have products of different size. On the top it has different sections so you can put some items like small bottles, eye liners, brushes, mascara and so on in there to keep those organized as well, which my other two lazy Susan organizers do not have, so this is kind of neat in my eyes. All my organizers are just a tad different so I keep them for different purposes, this one is great for lotions, dropper bottles and mascaras and such. It is very sturdy and a great addition to keep my things organized.", "label": 1}

It is packed with great for your lips ingredients such as hemp seed oil, Vitamin E and olive oil and no, it does not taste like olive oil. It is cruelty free which is another bonus in my eyes.<br /><br />It was a bit tricky to open though but once you get it it is actually a neat design, instead of twisting it on the bottom you twist it right by the bottom of the cap.", "label": 1}

It smells great and smells of grapes, which is actually a rare scent in beauty products and nice for a change. My skin felt and looked great when I used this serum. The price is also very reasonable so I for one can recommend this. I am also a fan of the pump dispenser, it is clean and easy to work with and keeps the rest of the product clean as well.", "label": 1}

I love coconut so when a lotion smells of coconut and makes me smell of it, well I am 100% in favor of it. But it gets better. Once you use this on your skin, it leaves you with super soft, beautiful looking skin that smells of coconut.

{"text": "Now this is quite the mascara. First of it comes in this beautiful container, full of bling, so this is for the girly girl of girls. I have to say I was a bit oh my when I saw that since I am not your girly girl. BUT when I used this I was rather impressed. I didn't think it really thickened my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. I didn't apply a ton since I used it during the day and not for a night out in town. It added a good amount of length to be honest and it didn't look fake, it was a \"wet eyelashes\" kind of look that I really liked. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is waterproof and definitely smudge proof.

Nowadays a lot of lip balms are flavored and to be honest that is one of the criteria why I pick certain lip balms.<br /><br />Yes this one works and its staying power is pretty good. It gets points for its sun blocking powers but I am deducting one for the lack of flavor, especially since I used other products from this line that definitely had the flavor/scent of grapes.", "label": 1}

I like that this palette allows you to cold or warm tone.<br /><br />The eye shadows are highly pigmented and are beautiful brown shades. Even though they are highly pigmented they blend out easily, including the darkest brown in the palette. When I used the shimmers I was not able to apply them with just a brush, but when I used my fingers they applied easily with a huge payoff. They were beautiful shimmers. The one thing missing in this eye palette is a very light colored shimmer for highlighting your brow bone and your inner eye corner. Plus I also like using lighter colors for the eye lid so I wished the shimmers were a bit lighter, or at least had one lighter one in the mix.<br /><br />This is a beautiful set with very nice mattes and shimmers that blend nicely and give you gorgeous looks for any occasion.", "label": 1}

The hair is a tad stiff, just like it is when you use hair wax. I don't use those kinds of products often so it is always a bit weird to me when I can't just run my fingers through my long hair.<br /><br />It washes out easily without any problems.

It was almost completely without scent, it may have had some very mild scent but I couldn't describe what it smelled like.<br /><br />To me it was weird to wash your face with something that felt more like a lotion than anything else.

Stiff enough however to stimulate to provide a good scrub, wet or dry for that matter.

The second brush is an oval brush that just has the stiff boar bristles that helps to exfoliate and smooths the skin.<br /><br />Using these brushes dry helps cleanse your skin but also stimulates your lymphatic system. It promotes blood circulation, helps excrete toxins and relaxes your muscles. Plus it just feels great! You can switch the handle between these two brushes for the one you need it for which is convenient in my eyes.

A tiny bit goes a long way!<br /><br />This product comes in cute little pump dispenser that works very well.

I was also supposed to get a makeup brush cleaner in this, but that was missing.<br /><br />In this set you get a powder brush that was nice and fluffy and worked well. You also get a foundation brush that was also very nice. The flat cream concealer brush worked well and you also get a concealer detail brush that again worked really well.

I\u2019m even ok with the firm bristles (nylon and boar), because I have coarse hair and I\u2019m not tender headed.  I like that it smooths the hair easily.  What I don\u2019t like is the PRICE. I can\u2019t believe they expect people to pay $49 for this brush. Yikes! And the sad thing is that it didn\u2019t even come in pretty packaging. Just in a simple white box.

{"text": "LaClaire (Beverly Hills) Clarifying Cleanser is a delight on the skin. Simply add a dime sized amount, with a little water and distribute on your face with your hands (or if you prefer a loofah).

There are some pretty nice ingredients that include tea tree oil, salicylic acid and aloe. I\u2019ve used the product for a few days now and have not noticed any dryness or irritation. Nor have I noticed any redness or rashes. The scent of the cleanser is not strong (smells like tea tree oil) and does not linger long. And finally, what I like the most? This company has made a product in a bottle that is reusable. I really like companies who have a philosophy to reduce their impact on the world. Being socially aware of how their products can affect the environment and actively doing something about it is a company that I can support.

{"text": "This is perhaps one of the most difficult reviews that I have written in a while. Usually I know immediately if the product is a hit or miss, but Vitabrid C12 is different. I can\u2019t decide. I\u2019m torn. After using VC12 for about 3 weeks, I am still unsure of the results.<br /><br />The concept: Vitamin C is slow released thru the skin by mixing a small amount of VC12, with water or a moisturizer, onto the face and neck. The results, brighter, smoother and firmer skin. The powder comes in a convenient small bottle (about the length of your thumb) with a small spoon (used for measuring). Simply mix the appropriate amount - I use about 2 spoonfuls since I put it on my face and neck- with a lightweight moisturizer. I didn\u2019t notice any tightness, irritation or itching after I applied this to my skin (i.e., face and neck). I simply apply my makeup as usual. With that being said, I haven\u2019t noticed anything bad either -no additional breakouts and no nasty white film (left on my face from bad blending). But I also haven\u2019t looked in the mirror and said \u201cwow\u201d or \u201cgosh, this is like a facelift in a bottle moment\u201d.  Not to mention that this product takes a little more effort than my usual skincare regime. I am not use to mixing products before I use them. **Therefore, I am going to give this product 3 stars BUT continue to use it for a little longer to see if I am wowed.

{"text": "I've been watching as every personality is raving about rose quartz and jade and microneedling etc. I did some research (from reputable sources) and there is actually some science to the use of these products. The microneedle blade is small enough for use. It makes little tiny, non-noticeable holes in the surface of your skin (in effect damaging it) so it will produce more collagen. While I wouldn't use it more than once a week, and just until my skin starts to get red, it does appear that my skin is softer and smoother after the treatment. So I'm find on the micro-needler. (Just remember gently, gently). The quartz roller is supposed to reduce redness, smooth the surface of the skin and help with lymphatic drainage. I'm not sure it actually does all that but it does feel nice and has definitely helped with under eye puffiness so it appears to be working. I'm very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of these devices and will continue to use them.<br /><br />The packaging is fine and makes them giftable but I'm not sure the quality of the pieces will actually hold up. I've been using them for several months and so far so good but if they do fall apart, I'm willing to invest in more expensive products.

I liked the masque overall and it seemed to improve the tone and texture of my skin. I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me. I've got very sensitive skin and this was not of problem for me to use (although I did patch test first). If you know what you are going into (the time and effort) I'd recommend this product.

{"text": "I am not new to nail stamping, but I only recently became aware of She Modern Sticky Stamping Polishes. With traditional stamping polish it is necessary to work very quickly in order to successfully transfer the image onto the nail, and beginners frequently struggle to get the timing down. Even experienced stampers have difficulties with extremely fine lines or highly detailed images; the stamping polish just dries too quickly inside the very shallow etching. After watching several She Modern videos on YouTube and ordering a small set of sticky stamping polishes, I was eager to test them out on a stamping plate I\u2019ve been unsuccessfully trying to use for over a year. My very first effort was flawless! The She Modern performed perfectly. Beginners will definitely find these polishes far, far easier to work with as they learn the basics, and more advanced stampers can enhance their artwork by using pigment powders, foils, and glitter. In addition, She Modern offers a comprehensive selection of watercolor polishes for techniques such as lead lining, reverse stamping, etc. The only limit is your imagination and She Modern even helps with that by providing live demonstrations of their products and techniques on YouTube every Tuesday and Friday. Tina very thoroughly and patiently opens each session by answering any questions from attendees before creating a nail design with various products. It\u2019s very helpful to see them in use and gives you ideas for your own nail art. It\u2019s a great line of products for nail artists at ANY skill level and the product support is outstanding!", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.

{"text": "As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.  This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I have been working with wigs for quite a few years now.  One thing I know is a good quality vs not so great quality wig.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />HAIR<br />This wig has some great hair. the colors are definitely platinum white and what I would call light auburn base hairs.  The white hairs are about 1/3 or so longer than the auburn hairs.  There is a nice kink to the hairs.<br /><br />THICKNESS<br />That is where this wig is sadly lacking.  At the top, the wefts of hair are way too far apart. The lace in the cap is a very light butter colored yellow.  The hair is not too thin, but it is not quite thick enough to cover hair below.  Yes, this comes with a nylon cap, but it just is not comfortable with those.  If you have dark hair it will definitely show the bright colored lace and elastics through the wig when the wind blows.<br /><br />BANGS/STYLE<br />That is where this wig is just not practical unless you don't mind looking stupid for a party or Halloween.  The bangs are WAY too long for anyone to wear.  That usually would not be a problem, but what you will get instead of the cool light ends on the entire head is chopped bang that is bland looking and then these white cool looking ends around the head.  The bangs are best cut painstakingly so that the auburn is cut way shorter (about 2/3) than the white hairs.  That takes a lot of time but worth the effort.  Then you have to cut them at a staggered manner.<br /><br />Other than the bangs being hard to trim so you can at least function with this wig on, the overall style is fabulous.  I love how it falls and looks while on the head.<br /><br />ELASTIC BANDS<br />Inside the wig, there are elastic bands with hooks to help hold the wig on the head. You might want to take them down to the spot you like it in as the hooks have a tendency to come undone during wearing.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT IN A WIG<br />Believe it or not, I would actually wear a wig like this with the right outfit, and not to be silly either.  I prefer wigs that look authentic,, and can be worn realistically as well as for fun.<br /><br />1.  I have to be able to see out of it<br />2.  I have to be able to wear it comfortably without fussing<br />3.  I want it to not have my real hair showing<br />4.  I want it to look realistic<br />5.  I want it to last for quite a few wearings<br /><br />DOES THIS WIG PASS THE TEST?<br />I am giving this wig THREE stars because it is hard to wear and see.  In order to trim this in a realistic manner, I have to take a LOT of time and that takes stars off for me.  I happen to love the style and coloring, so I am wiling to put the work into it, but honestly, I think it should be a bit shorter in the bangs area since it is so hard to trim and keep it looking real.  Also, the wefting on the top is just a bit too widely spaced.  I wish also that the cap was made with light auburn lace and elastic instead of the icy yellow colors.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to wear this for fun, it will be hard to see and hard to trim and not look silly in this.  It is comfortable and the style is epic, but there will be work required.  You can bandana it to help, but it still will look a bit floppy unless trimmed a little bit in the bangs/fringe area.  I like this, but it takes work to wear and not look silly for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  The trimming of the bangs is VERY time consuming since we only have one shot at it and if it is screwed up, then the wig is toast.  I wish there was more hair on top and that the lace cap did not show as easily.  A darker cap underneath (light auburn color) would have been much nicer with this.  I will still use this, but it could have been a bit nicer with small inexpensive changes.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.

{"text": "I am all about natural skin care.  When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.

I was hoping  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This mirror closes and snaps shut with a plastic clip on it.  It says open, but honestly, it is not easy to do.  Once open, the inside has the 10X magnifier on one side and the reguiar mirror surrounded by the light ring.<br /><br />ON/OFF<br />This has one light brightness- on.  There is a little switch on the back that you push from one side to the other to turn it on and off.  It does not shut the light off when you close it.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is quite slick.  If it is cold out and my hands are cold, it is sometimes a bit tough to hold on to this.  Most of the time it is not a problem.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS<br />This is a bit too bright for me.  It really does seem to be so bright that I can not look into the regular mirror long, but the magnifier is okay IF I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY PORES.  Sorry, but it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />This takes 2 CR2032 batteries.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I am not really that impressed with this mirror.  It works, but it is a bit frustrating to open, and bright to look into.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This works, but it is not the best light in my opinion.  That little switch on the back could easily be damaged in my purse.", "label": 1}
{"text": "When it comes to nail polish remover, I have two choices.  I use either the store brand, or professional brand, which is often pure acetone used in tough removal like gel polish.  Let's look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF POLISH?<br />I had on a very dark red polish which was wearing very intensely for a week.  Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do.  There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well.  It does not leave nails too stripped.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  It does what it is supposed to to without excessive problems or smells.", "label": 1}
{"text": "When it comes to styling devices, my family all has different preferences because we all have different hair.  This looked like a really great product.  Let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a nice box, well packed in a fancy presentation and comes with a little manual.  The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.  I am not sure if we got a bad one or what, but it just does not do hardly anything except leaving a partial bend in the hair no matter how we wind it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although a great concept, this curling iron did not seem to curl hair properly no matter what hair we used it on or how high or low the temperature was set.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  Great idea, just didn't work at all for us.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.", "label": 1}
{"text": "We have been through several Clarisonic brushes in our house (Mine kept dying) and my daughter swears by her Clarisonic Mia.  She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.", "label": 1}

This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent.

Its NOT gloppy like olive oil/almond/canola, seems lighter than grape seed oil even.<br />Worth the $. I lightly apply it through my hair the day I need to wash it- lightly oil all hair, twist up/clip, time it like a light hot oil treatment so it can soak in and work. It is a God send for unruley eyebrows. It washes right out no residue. I do this 2 times a week. I live in the desert/New Mexico/hard water/50 yrs/unprocessed thick semi curly hair.

If that happens it doesnt stain my clothes.<br />Oddly I have found for some reason it heals skin/cuts/wind burn more quickly than salves.<br />I keep my oil bottle on the (metal) end of an old frozen OJ tube style container- making a tiny saucer in case a drop oil seeps out.<br />Just my 2 cents....", "label": 1}

Nothing that was obvious unless one was very close, but it would be prevented from lining my lips which I don't normally think to do when using a stain.

The shadow itself is a creamy powder blend, and it suggests that you use your fingers for the metallic shades (I find a small crease blush works fine and tends to have less loose powder that way).<br /><br />You have a nice mix of matte and metallic shades this way, with a lot of earth tones. Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well. Why the three stars?<br /><br />I tried this with and without primer, and this kit definitely needs primer to last more than a couple of hours on my skin. Also? The mattes will last several hours, but not the metallics even with primer (as well as a setting spray on top).

I'm used to eyeshadow blending on me after a few hours, but never have I seen metallics melt away on me like this.

The tool will actually buzz gently when you should move to the next area. This is a great feature! It also comes with 3 brush heads; massage, sensitive and normal skin. I am using the sensitive for now and it is perfect for a gentle exfoliation. When I am finished with that minute, my skin just glows and feels so clean! Hopefully the heads do not need replaced quickly as I do not think they are yet available on Amazon or online. It also comes with a sleek charger that does not take up any room at all on the counter \u2013 this is important to me as I have a small bathroom. Also, the LumaRx comes with a very nice carrying case that will come in handy for an upcoming vacation.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Plastic and/or acrylic organizers come in all sizes, shapes, configurations and qualities.  MelodySusie\u00ae has blown me away with this three part, multiple sectioned organizer with drawers.  Just so you're clear, you get a base with four drawers, each with an flattened oval shaped pull, each lined with a black textile that can be removed or used as you choose.  The edges of the drawers are beveled, giving this an aura of elegance, but most importantly, each drawer slides in and out with ease, regardless of whether or not the drawer is packed or empty.  The bottom of the base has a little strip in the form which raises this organizer from sitting directly on the counter, so if it is used in a bathroom, air can circulate around the entire piece and grungy mildew and such is reduced from forming.  Don't forget to dust, though.  The exterior edges are beveled, giving them a very finished appearance, unlike those sharp edges on many similar products in the marketplace.<br /><br />Included with this organizer are two additional pieces, each is the same dimension as the interior of the top ridge of the chest organizer, so you can decide which one you want to put on top and which one you want to put next to the main component.  Or you can separate them entirely and use the top of the organizer to put items and use the two multi-sectioned components separately.  You could line them up side by side along a dresser top and have more width rather than extended height.<br /><br />I love the assorted sizes of the sections and the angles top of the shorter of the two pieces.  I also love the rounded design in the sections of the taller component.  Every aspect of this trio is outstanding, high quality, and it makes quite the impression in addition to comfortably storing whatever you like in each compartment.  Each edge is finished, every detail has been considered, and it is even practical in that it can quickly be cleaned with no harsh detergents. This lovely item was made in China and it is clear that quality control is important to the manufacturer because I saw no defect even after intense examination.  Be prepared for a weightier set than you might expect, because there was no skimping on the materials.  It is perfectly packed for protection and is ideal for presenting as a gift.

I usually still iron my hair, but it stays flat, even in Alabama's subtropical humidity. Otherwise, it doesn't matter what I do: by the time I walk from my house to the car, my hair is frizztastic. But with a keratin treatment, I can even just blow dry my hair and it look fantastic. This saves so much more time and it makes styling last for days. I also hike and get sweaty and my hair still looks great after it dries. Once, after a day of kayaking, I rode in the back of a friend's truck back to the marina, and my hair still looked terrific. This of all things has given me the hair I've dreamed of. And at $10-$15 per treatment, this price is right.<br /><br />Of course, it does smell terrible. And the fumes can sting your eyes, both as you apply it to your hair and as you iron it out.

{"text": "Since there aren\u2019t any reviews for this product, I thought I would write one for those who aren\u2019t familiar with the brand, or the item. I\u2019m now 66 years old and have been using only La Prairie products for my face since 2009/10. My face looks better than ever because of it. This item in particular is a very gentle, easy to apply and use, facial cleanser that doesn\u2019t require any water or actual washing process. It goes on a cotton pad (not the balls!), and not too much either, and you gently wipe your face and eye lids going in a circular motion - and always apply outwards and upwards. This will help your skin from being pulled down, which can cause more wrinkles. The company has changed the exact name of the product, but it\u2019s the same (only an improved version) as it always has been. For me, I use this as the first step in my nightly facial ritual - which is to cleanse the face. I follow with other products in stages, finishing up with the moisturizer (one for the face and a different one for the eyes). My rating of this being sold online is hard, since it\u2019s a wonderful product, however it\u2019s outrageously overpriced for what\u2019s a \u2018trial size\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 gift, given out with purchases of a full size La Prairie item (depending on how much you spend, and where you buy, it might be just one of multiple free trial size items). The FULL size of this item is about $100 USD, and it\u2019s around 8 ounces +/-. The bottle is probably 8\u201d high and a couple inches wide at least. So part of my rating is based on the product itself and the other part is on the price for this size. Another thing I want to mention is that I have sensitive skin and have never had any issues with this product line! You\u2019re face will thank you!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I liked this particular scent much more than others that I've tried, from both Michel Design and other brands. The peony has a distinctive smell to it but unfortunately it doesn't last long enough after taking a shower. The bar is a large oval shape and a little awkward to use at first - it gets easier as it's used more. The design of this and other products from MDW is very pretty and would make a nice gift for someone too. The soap has a LOT of creamy lather that that rinses clean and doesn't leave much soap scum on the shower walls. I have tried other triple milled soaps from L'Occitaine, Pre de Provence, Australian Soap Works, and 2 others that I can't readily recall the name of. All these are similar in price but the quality of this is much better, at least in my opinion. I have found that some fragrances are a bit stronger than others and I think it's just a matter of choosing one over another according to preference. This company makes so many different things for the kitchen and bath and I have bought quite a number of them for myself and plan on buying more for gifts. I noticed one review of this scent that said it had an awful smell to it, whereas mine is good - unfortunately this can happen if the bar is old and depending on the seller. This doesn't mean that every bar of soap is bad! My only negative comment is that the peony scent doesn't last long enough!", "label": 1}

In my opinion all of La Prairie's products are excellent and worth the high price - I don't use makeup so it's important for me to make my face look as good as it can be. I'm 61 years old and have been using this line for about 7 years. Depending on skin type and age I think some of their products work better than others.

{"text": "I had high hopes for this little baby, but after using for a few days, I must say it's just &#34;okay&#34;.  Perhaps it may be because when I bought it I had thick (or used to before my brush starting feasting on it) hair down to my butt and was tired of finding enough to knit my cat a sweater in my hair brush every morning.  So I wanted something that was more user friendly.  But then on an impulse I cut my naturally curly hair very short.<br /><br />The Pros:  It seems sturdy and well-made with a nice grain.  It's smooth (the teeth on the plastic picks tend to splinter and peel with time).  It feels comfortable to use.  It probably has good stay power.<br /><br />The Cons:  By far the biggest for me is that the teeth are spaced much more widely apart and are much thicker than I expected from the photo.  This means you can't really get the curl definition that the picks with a more narrow spacing will give you.  I also wish the handle were a bit longer.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Let me begin this review by stating that I have been using Egyptian, Indian and Pakistani 100% henna for over 30 years with beautiful results that lasted a full 3 months.  I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I'm dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it's messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine.  I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  Based on my experience, I'd have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don't work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning).  Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.)  Leaves me to wonder if the gray hairs would not be gray had I followed the advice of the other henna/indigo distributors.  Here's a good reference website:  [...]", "label": 0}

{"text": "For the past 4 years, I was using an expensive Braun dry shaver and not getting a close shave. Two months ago, I switched back to the old manual razor.  I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is. Especially shaving around the throat.  I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  I gave it a try.  The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn't last long at all.  One reviewer wrote that he uses regular shave gel. I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  I used that as if I was using a razor.  It works great.  Just rinse it off the shaver during shaving and after you finish, while the power is on. Since this shaver is made to use in the shower, using regular shave cream and rinsing the shaver doesn't cause any problem.  Given the price of razor blades, it won't bother me to spend $30 for replacement blades when needed.  I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn't give it 5 stars.  Buy the shaver, then using the much cheaper gel that you slap on your face.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Today I tried out Liquid Trust for the first time. I put some on before getting in the car with my husband. He sort of looked over at me at one point but I don't think he knew why. Two sprays on my wrists was all it took to see real effects. It made me feel sort of dreamy and not talkative. Like I just felt very relaxed and happy. We did not argue in the car for the first time in weeks probably because I was not talking up a storm as usual.<br /><br />People at the grocery store seemed to be smiling at me as I was walking around pushing my cart. I will say smiling may be an effect because when I saw my husband walking down the hallway at home before we left I smiled spontaneously and felt very happy to see him.<br /><br />My cat Wolfie thinks I'm great now too and when he smelled this on my wrists he got really affectionate and marked my wrists with his cheeks. A sure sign of approval.<br /><br />This has a slight powdery musky scent if anything. It is barely noticeable and my husband who hates me to wear perfumes did not complain at all! The ingredients are SD alcohol, purified water and oxytocin.<br /><br />So I feel this oxytocin perfume calmed down my anxiety in general which made other people around me more open and friendly.<br /><br />To be honest this was a surreal and dreamy experience. I felt calm, yet open and loving and very relaxed. When I keep sniffing my wrists after using it I feel a sort of calmly ecstatic in love feeling.<br /><br />I'd say this is the real thing. It also did not cause any sensual feelings and no one was attracted to me or me to them, this just reduced anxiety and made me more accepting. I did notice however that I was hyper aware of every man in the store. So it must trigger some protective elements in the brain.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to married couples who are looking to deepen their intimacy and who want to stop being irritated with each other and get along better.<br /><br />I avoided anyone pregnant while wearing this as advised!<br /><br />I am not a doctor nor is this review medical advice. Please consult with your doctor before using. I also don't advise using this for nefarious or deceitful purposes because the karma would not be good! Use at your own risk!<br /><br />For people in love in a committed marriage relationship, this Liquid Trust can help keep you calm when needing to talk. I'd suggest both people wearing the perfume on their wrists. The scent is sort of unisex and not overly strong. Very mild really, barely noticeable.<br /><br />So a good experience and it does what it says it is supposed to do. The anti-anxiety or anti-cortisol effects are very apparent. Don't you just need a break from stress now and then? Now you can spay this on your wrists and sit down and feel dreamy, happy and secure. For some confidence might be a nice side effect. That is probably why salespeople use this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "label": 1}

{"text": "If you are looking for Harvest themed movies the first two in this collection are perfect. Harvest Love is about a woman who find herself again when she goes home for a vacation. The love story has the usual conflict at the start but the characters fall in love slowly and with a lot of restraint. No kissing until right at the end! Made me want to try pear desserts. Harvest Love is very innocent but has a little romantic dancing at a festival. I'd say it should be rated PG for this.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie Wars was really cute and I loved that the women in the movie all ended up friends again in the end. Basically you have two best friends who have a falling out and it takes years for them to even speak to each other again. The happy ending in this can't be beat! Plus lots of baking competitions and romance. A little kissing but that is it.<br /><br />Truly Madly Sweetly made me feel uncomfortable for the most part because the characters were always in conflict. While the ending is happy I just felt like I would probably not watch it again. I don't mind when characters don't like each other at the start, but to be fighting for different goals basically the whole movie was not as enjoyable to watch. I also wondered what would really happen in their circumstance if the ex wife decided she wanted her husband back. It all felt a bit too risky for me.<br /><br />But no violence, swearing or anything objectionable in any of the movies. The G rating seems true for the last two of the movies at least. PG for Harvest Love.<br /><br />And I must admit my big strong husband came and sat right next to me while I was watching Harvest Love. These movies are enjoyable for men to watch too. Apparently. ;)))) He watched all three. But his question was...\"Why are all these movies the same just with different actors?\" I told him they are just what women love to watch over and over again. It is the romance we crave. So we enjoy watching two characters fall in love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "label": 1}

{"text": "When I first tried this Marshmallow Vanishing Cr\u00e8me in a sampler kit, I purchased five more kits and then a 1.5 ounce glass container of this product. Can I say it is addictive? Yes, I guess it does have a banana scent and the texture is similar to a banana cream pie topped with whipped cream.<br /><br />To say this is decadent is an understatement. You will be very tempted to slather your entire body in a good helping of this cream. Fortunately, it goes a long way and absorbs extremely well. In fact, that is why they call it \"vanishing\" cr\u00e8me. The ingredient list is impressive and contains rose water, mango butter, beeswax, grapeseed oil, rosehip seed oil, Vitamin E, marshmallow extract, willowbark extract, calendula flower extract, and a heady fragrance.<br /><br />Grapeseed oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants and is high in proanthocyanidins, a group of bioflavonoids that are superior because they are water soluble. This ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure.<br /><br />\"Marsh Mallow\" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows. It has been used for centuries as a food and a medicine. The leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with healing properties for inflamed skin. In the past, people boiled the roots in wine to make a cough remedy.<br /><br />I found this luscious creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind. Not only will you feel comforted by nature, your skin will be baby soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing. The silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal. If you love this product, you might want to try the Pore-refining mask, Evening Primrose Overnight Cr\u00e8me and the very unique parsley blemish stick. To take luxury to the next level, try the Shea Butter Decollete Cr\u00e8me on your feet, hands or all over your entire body. What an amazing line of products. They heal, protect and soothe your mind.<br /><br />I'm still trying all the Burt's Bees products, and love how these products make me feel.

{"text": "I use fractioned oils to make rollerballs for my oil blends and for a carrier for various topical uses.<br />I have been wanting to recreate a muscle cramp relief oil from a major essential oil club and lucked up with a copycat recipe.  These oils are over $30 for 5ml and, while it works great and smells amazing, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to spend that knowing that I have a box full of single oils.<br />When I saw this bottle with the pump, I knew it was time to try my hand and mixing this recipe.  I had a few other rollerballs that I wanted to make (some decongestant and immune boosters since it\u2019s getting to that time of year) so I inserted the pump and got to work.  The oils mixed VERY well and the pump on the bottle made it very easy to dispense just enough into the small rollerball opening.  That is SUCH a nice feature \u2013 manufacturer, please don\u2019t remove that from the item.  I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve spilled my fractioned oil everywhere because it was difficult to contain since it\u2019s thin.<br />Once I had worked through the 5 rollerballs for my family needs, I had enough room in the bottle to make a BIG batch of the massage oil with the rest of the fractioned oil.  IT WORKED!!!  I\u2019m soooooo happy with this bottle of fractioned oil.  I can easily pump out what I need to work out my sore muscles and apply to hubby\u2019s back (he has scholosis and other degenerative issues).

Some of the sandwiches are already pulling apart and do not feel sticky. The hair itself smelled slightly synthetic while I styled it, and I noticed the ends bubbled up with heat application like synthetic would. I also noticed several strands of super thick, plastic-feeling pieces. I pulled one off the weft and it snapped apart like it was plastic. Tried to take a picture of the bubbled ends as well as one of the thick pieces.<br /><br />I've used other inexpensive brands that have had better tape, and don't mind synthetic when you know it's what you'll get.

After rubbing my eyes since the last night, the top lashes held and I didn't wake up with raccoon eyes. however, it does flake a bit.

It wasn't the natural-looking coverage I had come to expect. Just goes to show they're not all the same.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

{"text": "I have finally found the perfect flat iron for my bangs.  The Milantia Mini Hair Straightener 3/4\" Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron heats up fast to take care of my half curly bangs that have a mind of their own.<br /><br /> I have coarse thick hair, but my bangs have thinned with age and have started developing weird curls and cowlicks. It's the only part of my hair that needs the nuclear option because I keep the rest of it braised most of the time.<br /><br />I don't have time for a lot of hair care, and this little flat iron heats up fast and does exactly what I need it to do. It's small, lightweight,  nimble, and exactly what I have been looking for!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

{"text": "Even though I am not fond of the paper masks (prefer collagen), there is no denying they work well and my aging skin feels replenished, hydrated and rejuvenated. I have very sensitive skin due to seborrheic dermatitis, so I have to be very careful with skincare products. Why do I always feel the need to test them on Sunday when I have work the next day? No worries, my skin will look great and If I can find the time I may do another treatment in the morning to give my skin a little more radiance. There is no denying the results.<br /><br />Pro Tip: They work even better when you put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before use. It will help tighten the pores up and feels extra refreshing!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

{"text": "Okay, I am a fan but with caveats. I love the long chiseled pencil shape because it makes it easier to apply straight stokes of color to my very thin brows without looking drawn on or penciled in. However, it does skip a bit compared to my gel brow color that is applied with a brush. The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx. It works, it stays and looks great. Gals with thicker brows will reap the most benefit b using the mascara type brush for the most natural look and pigment distribution.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I'm so sad to give this product one star.  I purchased this after seeing the craze on social media and had to try it.  The day I arrived I gave it a try and absolutely loved the result, I felt like my face was flawlessly covered, not cakey, and that I was able to use less foundation than I was used to. The next day, I went to try it again and realized that the outer layer of the silicone applicator had peeled off on the back.  The inside of the applicator is very sticky, so that rendered that one useless.  I figured it was a dud and tried the next one, The same exact thing happened! I was using very light pressure and rinsed with water after each use. Additionally, my foundation is made for sensitive skin and is very eco friendly. so I know that there is no way that the foundation eroded the applicator. Needless to say, I am very disappointed, these things are awesome until they're not.", "label": 0}

{"text": "I originally purchased this eyeliner at a Kohls department store for my daughter for her to practice with makeup. However, I ran out of my regular eyeliner one day and I had to use I had to use hers. It was soooo AMAZING that I immediately went to Amazon to see if they had and to my pleasant surprise, they did.<br /><br />It glides on with ease, its true to color and doesn't lighten after application. Its EXTREMELY precise and beyond easy to use. It is by far genuinely the EASIEST liquid eyeliner I have used in my 25plus years of using liquid liners. The felt tip is more hardened which makes its SUPER easy to control and place on the eyelid, whereas other liquid liners have softer felt tips which are floppy and they bend easy leaving you with having to press lightly so you don't mess up your straight line. This E.L.F liner is opposite of ALL that, its hard but not TOO hard that it doesn't glide precisely with your stroke. It has a PERFECT sized super thin tip which allows me to give my cat eye a precise small line finish at the corner of eye, it's perfection!<br /><br />My most FAVORITE part of this liquid eyeliner is that it does NOT get cakey, if I want a thicker more pronounced look, I can go over the same line several times and it doesn't cake up. I mean sure if you're gonna put 10 layers on, I'm sure it'll eventually cake, but building  with 3 layers, no cake! First time I tried to do thicker line, I was so nervous not wanting to mess up my entire eye makeup, but I had faith and gave it a try and was SHOCKED that it didn't get thick and cakey, and it still looked like I only had 1 layer of eyeliner on.<br /><br />Did I mention it stays put! I'll sometimes get watery eyes in the corner of my eyes, and this magic liner doesn't smudge, doesn't rub off, it could be that my make up setting spray helps, or it could be the eyeliner, but whatever it is its definitely some sort of sorcery. Haha.... But regardless with the insanely affordable price, you WON'T be disappointed!!!<br /><br />It removes SUPER easy with make up remover, or just soap and water, I always wash my face, then use make up remover to get any remaining make up off, and the eyeliner always seems to be gone after just soap and water.<br /><br />Truly the best bang for your buck!!!!", "label": 1}

{"text": "* I received this item at a heavy discount in exchange for my honest opinion and review*<br /><br />At first I was unsure about this product. I opened it up and it looks like whipped mashed potatoes which is a little odd and didn't really smell like anything (it's unscented which is good); not pleasant or unpleasant. I decided to try it on myself first before trying it on my child. When the seasons change I get super bad dry skin on the tops of my hands that ends up itching, burning, and becoming scaly. As the weather has been cold the last week, my hands started to flare up. It only took TWO applications of this in one day to stop the itch and burning and start to heal my skin.<br /><br />I used it for my daughter the first time this week as well and after one overnight after the cream, the slight redness she had was gone. I would definitely recommend this and will be purchasing more in the future!<br /><br />Best features:<br />Huge container<br />Works fast<br />Super moisturizing<br /><br />Possible improvements:<br />It is slightly oily until it soaks in and dries<br />Scent (maybe something natural like coconut oil would help this?)", "label": 1}

Unfortunately I didn\u2019t  see any replacement heads to order on Amazon. I would have liked the kit to come with more heads,  it comes with two, one to use and one replacement . I really like the aloe strip that surrounds the 5 blades , most of my other razors it\u2019s just on one side. The razor cuts close and is comfortable to use.

The water well holds a fair amount of water however I would like it to hold a bit more. It has many levels of power for the water to spray out. The low is very weak and the high is pretty darn strong and could be painful if you aren\u2019t careful. There are plenty of adjustments in between so you will find one that suits your mouth just right. It also has a \u201cmassage \u201c button which basically cuts down the strength of the jet and makes it pulse to massage your gums. I find it a bit too soft of my gums , even on the highest level.  This product does a great job in cleaning between your teeth and below gum line. I hate to floss so this is a great option to keep my teeth clean and well cared for. If your house is Not new and only has one plug in your bathroom, you will appreciate the long cords- both the electrical and the water hose. One thing I like about this water flosser  is that it does NOT leak like my other one did. This keeps my counter neat. This is a good product to add to your daily dental hygiene regimen .

{"text": "Eeeeeeekkk I'm so excited about this!! I love my Dry Bar Buttercup hair dryer, but really wanted a diffuser for it because I like to scrunch my hair time to time. When I added it to my cart, it was $21 I believe. That's still cheaper than Sephora so I was going to get it but waited. SO GLAD I DID. Randomly, it dropped to $12.12!!!! Purchased immediately!!<br /><br />It fits my hair dryer perfectly. But, I can tell by looking at it that my hair dryer isn't a standard size on the end so I had to purchase the Bio Ionic brand since that's who makes my hair dryer. Worth it! It says universal, but I would still take measurements to make sure it'll fit yours if it isn't a Bio Ionic brand because they are not ever all universal.<br /><br />The part that attaches to your hair dryer is not a hard plastic- it is rubbery (but firm) so it slides onto your hair dryer but doesn't &#34;click&#34; into place. I think that's why they say it's universal because this allows for some difference in the size of your dryer. But still do your research and compare your hair dryer to the size of the Buttercup hair dryer because it fits it perfectly.<br /><br />You can also twist the diffuser to open up the vents or close them to control the air flow (see pictures). There will always be air flow on the outer ring of the diffuser, but you can completely close off the center, which is nice if you don't want a ton of force.<br /><br />I love it and it was completely worth it!", "label": 1}

I'm happy to say, I was wrong, and pleasantly surprised by how well it actually worked! This set comes with two strong clips for helping you separate your hair and a cleaning brush.<br /><br />You'll need to start with clean, dry, and tangle-free ( as much as possible) hair for best results. If you want to change the temperature setting from Celsius to Fahrenheit just press down on both temperature buttons at the same time. Also, They have temperature recommendations based on hair types; 410\u00b0F-446\u00b0F (210\u00b0C~230\u00b0C) for fine hair.<br />374\u00b0F-410\u00b0F (190\u00b0C~210\u00b0C) for normal hair.<br />338\u00b0F-392\u00b0F (170\u00b0C~200\u00b0C) for soft hair.<br /><br />  What I really like about this brush:<br />1. It gives my hair a more natural-looking straight hair versus my flat iron.<br />2. It's very easy to use.<br />3. The bristles are very long which keeps the heating element away from your fragile scalp. I never felt my head get hot while using it.<br />4. I could safely and easily use this brush on my oldest daughter to tame her hair craziness. I wouldn't say that about my flat iron.<br />5. This brush would work for most hair types. My underneath layers of my hair are very thick, coarse, and extremely curly while the top layer is thinner, and just wavy.<br /><br />  My dislikes:<br />1. The control buttons are placed very inconveniently on the brush handle making it very difficult to not accidentally change setting while in use.<br />2. The bristles are long. This makes it safe to use, but difficult to tame those little flyaways that are very close to your head.<br /> 3. This isn't a problem for my hair, but from my use of this product I don't think it would work well for those that have spiral curls.<br />4. The back side of the brush also gets extremely hot; be careful!<br /><br />  Overall, I really like this brush and feel it is well worth it's price! I will still keep and use my flat iron for special events, but i know I will use this brush for everyday styling.<br />  I received this product in exchange for honest feedback.

Ive used Honest Amish, and a local beard oil, but my girlfriend didn't like the smell of the H.H. and the oil just wasn't enough to keep my beard in check.  This My Best Beard beard balm fits perfectly!  It has a nice smell and my girlfriend loves it too!  My beard is also noticeably softer after just a few days!  I really enjoy this beard balm and I plan on purchasing from PureSouth Naturals in the future.  The Beard brush that is included in this kit is also really nice.  I haven't had any bristles come out while using it and it feels nice on my beard.  Plus it comes with the nice carrying bag for when you go away from home!  Overall, this is definitely the best beard/balm/wax Ive used and I recommend it.", "label": 1}

Most popular, name-brand face lotions are around 65%-80% on the EWG Health Rating. I use the EWG (Environment Working Group) as a reference when checking products and try to stay away from the alarmist side. Only 8% of this product is considered \u201cmoderate risk\u201d mainly polyarylamide, Fragrance (unnecessary additive; possible allergy) , alcohol denat. (Bad for dry skin, bad for sensitive skin, potentially block pores) and BHT (also found in edibles, rubber products and is banned in UK and EU due to limited research showing BHT is linked to cancer). This product is good for brightening, anti-aging and promotes wound healing.  It also contains steric acid which can potentially block pores.<br /><br />Keep in mind, everyone\u2019s skin is different and what effects one person may not effect another.

{"text": "This product is the first cleansing oil I've used on my face. I'm really enjoying it. It easily removes makeup and leaves me with a soft face and no break-outs after removing my make-up. My nineteen year old son, JUST came up to me and gave me a hug good-bye and commented on how soft my face was. True story! This hasn't happened before, and the only difference to my cleansing regimen has been this cleansing oil. So far I'm loving it. It easily and smoothly goes on my face and removes my make-up. The cleansing oil smells nice, it's using light, nice smelling oils and feels good on my face. I highly recommend it.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I received my new Argan Oil shampoo and was super excited to start using it. I have thick natural, healthy, unprocessed shoulder length hair. What I noticed with this shampoo was first of all it took a lot of shampoo the first time I washed it (one of two times) to get my hair to lather. Since this is organic I was not surprise to find this, but disappointed that it seemed to take so much shampoo. My fix the second time I washed my hair was to use a different shampoo for the &#34;starter wash&#34; and to use the Argan oil for the final wash. I LOVE how the shampoo smells and how it looks when I've finished blow drying and styling my hair. My hair is quite thick and can get kind of frizzy and have fly aways which did not happen with this shampoo. Typically I cannot wash my hair everyday, as it usually takes a couple days for my hair to &#34;fall&#34; and not look so &#34;big&#34;. Fortunately, my hair looked great immediately with this new shampoo. I also washed my hair before a house party for New Years and had MANY compliments from various family members over the wonderful smell of my shampoo. Several requests were made by my mom, sister, sister in law and niece to tell them the name of my shampoo. It has a fresh spa like scent and appears to be a cross between a bit of honey and vanilla in the fragrance. I LOVE this shampoo and was very excited to have the opportunity to review this product for my unbiased opinion.", "label": 1}
{"text": "My feet and my hands get dry and end up looking wrinkled and dry. I've tried lots of different products and I'm always on the look out for a good hand and foot moisturizer. This Shea Butter Hand Cream comes in a beautiful box that is tightly wrapped in plastic. When you open the jar you are greeted by a pleasant aroma - hard to describe, even though it says it has lavender as an ingredient I did not really smell lavender as a smell. The cream is thicker than normal hand lotion but not super thick and it does not feel greasy, it feels nice and quickly absorbs into your skin. I received this product at a discount for my unbiased opinion and really like this product. I especially love shea butter and that this shea butter hand cream is made of all natural ingredients.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have type 3A hair (naturally curly, coarse and thick) cut into a pixie style. I wear my hair straight more often than not and blow dry with 2 different size round brushes. Since my roots are very curly, I need a smaller flat iron to get to the roots since my hair is short. I've tried using a regular size and it's too large to reach my roots. I've tried probably 6 different flat irons and this one I actually saw on an Instagram post. It doesn't have a temperature setting; you turn it on and that's it. However, this thing gets HOT! The way it feels in your hands is perfect, it's not awkward feeling. The fact the handle is a little thicker makes it easier to hold and it also has grooves so you're able to grip it well while straightening. This is the best flat iron for shorter hair styles!", "label": 1}

{"text": "Magnetic eyelashes are an interesting concept for those times you want a dramatic look but don't want the hassle of glue on lashes.  The magnetic liner works well but it must be applied pretty thick in order to give enough area for the lashes to stick.  You have to be careful when placing them also as  you cannot really adjust the position because pulling the lashes off usually tears the liner off with it, so you have to then clean the lashes and reapply liner if you make a mistake which is kind of a hassle.  The two lashes included here are nice but neither one really worked for my eye shape, I got another kit which had 7 different shapes in it and that one had two styles that work well for me so I would probably recommend getting one with more options to ensure you find one that fits your eye shape.", "label": 1}

It was at the point where I couldn\u2019t even run my fingers through it without kinks. My hair felt like straw and always looked dry and frizzy no matter what I did to it. After using this, my hair feels amazing. Smooth and has a nice slip to it. No more kinks. I think the best part is that this doesn\u2019t wash off. I\u2019m not sure how many showers I have to go through before I have to reapply, but I can tell one tube will last me for a while. After you shower, grab enough of this to cover a thin layer in your hair and then blow dry. It will feel sticky and tacky but once your hair is completely dried, it will just feel like smooth silky hair. If you feel you put too much in one area, put some water in that area to thin the cream and then blow dry again.<br /><br />I really wish I found out about this product before I chopped off my hair.

I am male and have sensitive skin that's prone to irritation that results in random pores getting clogged on my arms or chest or legs.  I bought these on a recommendation to test out and see if they helped.  I've only had them for a few days, and can't really say yet if they've done anything for my pores or not, but they do seem to be doing a really good job at exfoliating my skin.<br /><br />The individual towels are roughly 12 inches wide by 24 or 30 inches long.  They're made of some sort of woven nylon or plastic material that is kind of wavy and extremely abrasive when rubbed across the skin.  You use the towel by putting a dollop of liquid soap onto it and then rubbing it onto your body to create a lather.  The towel is long enough that you can easily scrub your back by holding the ends of the towel and pulling back and forth.  The towels are abrasive enough that it really feels like you're scraping a layer of skin off.  Probably not appropriate for use anywhere sensitive.<br /><br />I'm loving these so far.

The two pieces lack the fancy features of more expensive pieces, but my dentist says all those extra features are not worth the money.

I've always used string floss in the past, but this water flosser seems to work just as well most of the time. Sometimes there is some food stuck in my teeth that I still have to use the string for.<br /><br />As I said, features are minimal. There is 1 charger for both devices, so you can't use the charger as a stand for both items. Instead of all the cardboard in the box, why not include a cheap plastic tray or stand? There also is no travel case, just a little cover for the toothbrush head. I would really prefer a full length hard case to be included instead of having to buy an aftermarket case that doesn't fit well. Also, you only get one tip each for both the flosser and the toothbrush and there is nowhere to easily store extras.

But unless your nail is free of bumps, humps, divots, etc., it's going to take a long time to shine the nail evenly. What you end up doing is making thin/weak spots in the nail which will cause breaks or cracks as the nail grows out because these files take off a lot of nail.

{"text": "&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34; - I got these when they were an Add-On Item for $3.99, definitely worth the price. The stamper works great, I didn't even wash it first (even though you should always wash new stampers before first use), and it's slightly (I do mean slightly) softer then other clear stampers I own.<br /><br />If you're new to stamping or not familiar with clear stampers, they are more delicate than opaque ones and tear easily, so be gentle with it. Wash it with dish soap & warm water, dry with a paper towel and clean it with a lint roller or tape. Never buff it or use acetone, you'll make it cloudy defeating the purpose of a clear stamper. When picking up, ROLL GENTLY over the image if you apply too much pressure it won't pick up. When applying the image to the nail press straight down (again, with GENTLE pressure) and rock side to side or roll from side to side. Don't push the tip of the nail into it, it will tear.<br /><br />All the plates stamp great, I didn't swatch every image, although plates 29 & 41 have shallow etching (in my experience this is normal for BP plates) so the thinner scraper is a nice addition. It's not as thin as the 0.5mm and not a thick as the 1mm ones I own, I'd say it's 0.75mm (I didn't get out the calipers). There are different size images, a little for every nail size. But I do wish the water marble designs were bigger, I'm not a Water Marble Witch yet. Plate 52 is great for lead lighting or Sharpie water coloring.<br /><br />The stamping guide works like it's supposed to, I've added a photo to show how it's used just in case it's confusing. I have a set of 4 templates from another brand already, there's not much difference in size or thickness of the metal but the designs are different. The edges aren't finished, like a plate with no backing, but I don't think it would cause anyone to slice their finger open unless you're being extremely careless.<br /><br />All in all a great set.", "label": 1}

I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.<br /><br />If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out. This 4 oz bottle will last you a very long time, I still have about half the bottle I bought in Feb. 2015, and costs a fraction of the price as those other brands marketed specifically for nail art.", "label": 1}

These tools are bladed scrapers that are used to gently scrape away dead skin and tiny hairs to give your face a fresh, clean, healthy look. In the videos I watched, there was a considerable amount of icky skin removed- literally piles of it! My experience has been much less dramatic. A whole face application resulted in just a tiny amount of \"dust\" to be removed. I applied a bit too much pressure at first and gave myself a little scratch, so do be cautious. These blades are sharp!<br />I feel that my skin does look brighter and more healthy. Those videos of dermaplaning likely feature models who had been tanning and not washing their faces so the dirt and oil really built up, and skin was ready to peel.<br />This product removes tiny \"peach fuzz\" hairs but I also tried it on a small patch of coarser leg hair that I had missed while shaving.

The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable. It would definitely work for larger dogs as well. The price is reasonable and considering so many other similar brushes received poor reviews, I'm especially happy with this for the price.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I bought this out of curiosity about foam cleansers and because a reviewer said it smells like coconut. Actually, it smells like citrus pine to me, which makes a lot more sense looking at the pinecones on the package and the fact is says there pine leaf, grapefruit, and citron extracts. It's a nice scent if you like those. Anyway, I'm finding one pump of these foams work for me (maybe I would need more if I was wearing makeup, and I wish I could tell you how well this removes makeup). This spread thicker than other foams I have used so far. It felt like it did a good job cleaning and left my skin soft and fresh. The price is on par with other foam cleansers I've tried. This would last me a long time since I only need one pump, but I'm just as happy with cheaper cleansers with scents I prefer.", "label": 1}

I give it a slight edge over my old one because the rose quartz is pretty. I'm not sure if it is anti-aging because I don't really pay attention to that. If it is having an effect, then great, but for me, the rolling action helps me wind down at the end of the day. The motions are soothing and quartz is cool against the skin. It is easy to clean and it keeps well too. With the two roller bottles, it does make a nice gift set. But this is a set that I'm keeping. Hopefully this one doesn't disappear.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I like this Makeup Sponge Beauty Makeup Sponge Blender Professional Foundation Sponge. It says \"Snowflakes\" on the plastic box but I don't know if that is the actual brand name. Given the teardrop design, it probably can be used with a powder based item like eye shadow, but I prefer to use it for foundation blending/application. I like how sponges can use a bit of water with the foundation to help with spreading the foundation on the skin and this sponge does a nice job of this. The foundation goes onto the skin so it looks sheer, fresh and polished. It also does a good job of blending so concealer conceals but doesn't appear obvious. I like that is easy to clean and doesn't have the \"make up sponge\" smell. If anything makes me stop using a make up sponge, it is the rubber-y used smell that it can get, but this sponge doesn't have that smell so I'm glad of that.<br /><br />Overall, it is a nice makeup tool to have in the make up box.

It is important to do a test curl if your hair is a bit longer in order to ensure the bottom curls as much as the top. I didn't time it right last time and the bottom of my hair didn't curl as tightly as the top. A test time would have helped.

As I've gotten older my skin has gone from mixed to quite dry, and this facial moisturizer just ends the flaking and itching, just stops it dead.<br /><br />I can't say if there's an anti-aging effect going on here since the only place my age shows on my skin is on my face, but if the way my skin feels after applying it is any indication, I'm getting younger by the day.  It's a generous 3.4 oz of cream for your money, and you don't need to apply a lot to get the bene fit.  So if you have dry skin anywhere on your body, I would say don't hesitate to try this stuff.

{"text": "I have a big fluffy beard. Unfortunately in the winter, it more resembles a brillo pad in texture and I sometimes look like a homeless person.<br /><br />This oil works well to condition and treat your beard, and the skin underneath. I apply it right out of the shower after towel drying my beard while it is still damp. I use three squirts of oil, placed in my palm, run my hands together and massage into my beard. It keeps my beard soft and supple all day, and treats the skin underneath to stop dryness and itching.<br /><br />I almost thought of trimming my magnificent beard down because it was so rough, and it was itchy, this is allowing me to continue to grow it.<br /><br />My beard hair is soft, manageable, and free of knots.<br /><br />The glass bottle is heavy duty, so you can take it when you travel.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is the cost. It's pretty expensive, but I think a bottle would last you 2 months or so, but it's still a pretty hefty price to pay for a soft and manageable beard, free of itchiness.", "label": 1}
{"text": "My wife is a professional hair stylist. She cuts my hair every 2-3 weeks and relies heavily on using electric shears to do so.  This unit works very well. It can work plugged in, or with battery, which should give you about 40 minutes of time per charge.<br /><br />The shears are sharp and do a great job of cutting through my thick hair. The attachments are also very nice. Unlike other units that have 6 or 7 different guards depending on what you want to do. It has a fixed length one, a short variable one, and a long variable one. For my hair she used the short variable one.  The settings go from 1/16 of a inch up to about 3/4 inch, and the long variable one goes up from there.<br /><br />Having the variable length guards is great as it reduces the number of guards you need and allows you to change lengths on the fly.<br /><br />Using the shears without the guard is also good for trimming to the skinline, edging and shaping.<br /><br />The only complaint my wife had is that she wishes it were a little more powerful on battery, but wasn't really lacking in power, it is just that she usually uses professional shears. This unit is actually as powerful or more powerful than most shears you buy at walmart or the like.<br /><br />Overall a great shear for home hair cutting.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a great way to trim your beard. A definite step up from traditional trimmers. The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess. You don't make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.<br /><br />The trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand. It has an detachable cord that allows the unit to be charged. It can operate on the cord or off it's batteries for cordless use. The trimmer is NOT submersible.<br /><br />The attached guard can be adjusted to 9 length settings with a rotating selector. It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas. There is also a separate smaller attachment that can be used for precision cuts.<br /><br />The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the \"Turbo\" button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal. There are still a few hairs that don't get sucked up but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.<br /><br />The only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small. There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of it.<br /><br />Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards. A must have!!", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a very good product for those of us who want to have fun with enhancing skimpy eyelashes.  There are some excellent mascaras available, but for pizzazz you can't beat false eyelashes.  The only problem, and this isn't a huge one, is that the strip that on which you apply the adhesive is very very thin and flexible.  This makes it hard to apply the adhesive evenly and to achieve a strong hold.  With practice this becomes less of a problem.  The scissors are nice, not spectacular and not very sharp; but a nice addition.  All in all a good buy and great for us makeup artists or rather those of us who would like to be.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Quickly approaching (a still, sadly, rather vain) age 40, I have personally spent a small fortune over the years trying to slow the aging process and reverse the effects of too many days spent gardening without sunscreen.  I cannot even begin to list all the products I've somewhat foolishly gambled on to get my skin looking better.  This product--and several other products offered through the company NEOTERIC (all under the Alpha Hydrox brand)--are exactly the answer I've been looking for.  I've used them both alone and in conjunction with a more expensive brand of anti-aging products (for which I've also left good reviews on this site), and I can see great improvements both ways.<br /><br />I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy cream after reading in Dr. Oz's (and Dr. Roizen's) book [[ASIN:0743292561 You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You)]].  I'd tried several other alpha hydroxy products before this one (i.e. ROC, etc.) and must say this particular line (ALPHA HYDROX) is far superior to any other I've used.  That it is also apparently considerably less expensive than most is icing on the cake, in my book.<br /><br />Regarding this product, I find the key is to use it AT LEAST once a day, and always after using a mild cleanser.  At my age I still get acne and, despite my sometimes manic picking, I notice it (and any residual puffiness or redness, and resulting scarring) clears up much, much more quickly than it used to.  Also, my skin breaks out much less than before I used this.  The tone and color of my skin are far improved when compared to prior to using this product.  I've run out of it before and tried to use something else until I was able to locate more locally, and to my dismay the condition of my skin began to deteriorate.<br /><br />I won't try to insult anyone by saying the Alpha Hydrox line will remove every wrinkle or fix all your skincare woes.  If there is a product out there that does this, I want to know!  But for now, this is by far the best line of products I've used.  I use this item, particularly, with the line of skincare I reviewed previously, as that seems to address reversing the signs of aging better (where this one, for me, just improves the overall condition and appearance of my skin).", "label": 1}

Now I use more sporadically, to hide what scars are left but this product seems to help them fade! If I apply it when I feel one coming on, it helps to reduce the inflammation and rids it quicker. That could really be because there is green tea in it.  My daughter uses it to hide her teen acne and in fact my son puts a teeny tiny drop on his cystic spots as well to tone down the redness.

{"text": "My husband used this kit and took, when asked to do a bit of a review on it for me, took it very seriously. The price isn't cheap so he wanted to make sure to really look at everything as he used it. Here is what he had to say:<br /><br />\"You have a pack of accessories here so I thought I would run through them in turn to tell you what you are getting and my impression of it<br /><br />Shampoo and body wash.<br />Okay, I ran through this way too quick and used all of it. It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.\"<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set. He's still talking about it so he did like it, just thought it was a bit much.", "label": 1}

Now I don't know if this is just my hair being obnoxiously dry or not but that would be the only thing that I could say anything remotely \"bad\" about. The conditioning was just not quite enough on the ends of my hair. Great on the already healthy stuff, just seemed to ignore the drier ends. Figured I'd get that over with and move on to the good stuff.<br />This really gave my hair a nice shine to it. My hair is getting old with me and it no longer wants to be as manageable and tame as it once was. With this duo of delight my hair looked healthy after it dried. It looked good when left to air dry, when dried with the hot air brush, and when left to air dry. It looked shiny without the added matching shine spray (which is also a wonderful product) and with. I left out the word smooth in this so far but let me tell you! It was also smooth and sleek without having to use other products to make it stay that way. Granted, under all that grey old hair there has always been fairly thin straight hair so this just really put it back to looking like it used to in that regard. The shampoo cleaned it to the point of being squeaky clean as well.<br />Give this duet a try if you can. It works really well and smells alright to boot!", "label": 1}

I asked him to let me know how he felt about it after using it. Here is what he had to say about it:<br /><br />\"So like many people i have been wearing a mask all day. It's hot and it becomes humid under the mask. Perfect breeding place for acne. It was forming all around my mouth. I'm not going to complain about it. Just that's how it is now, and we have to work with it.<br />This serum seemed to be working at first. It's easy to apply using the dropper. Just squeeze a few drops on to the affected area and let it dry in.<br />You will notice when you use it that your skin appears to be tightening. Also with continued use the red marks on your face will lighten and eventually fade.<br />I had to stop using it. I believe it was working at first but after some continued use it was making things worse and the acne was spreading. I have a slightly oily skin type and this may not have been best suited to me.<br />Glad I tried it and I have a feeling that it may work better for a different skin type than mine.\"<br /><br />There you have it.

They are sturdy and work very well. When used for what they are supposed to be used for specifically I thought they all held up well and did their jobs. They detangled perfectly and when used for styling they were easy to hold on to, didn't get in the way at all, and worked the hair into it's style nicely.<br />I would recommend these if you are looking for a good set of hair brushes and combs that won't cost you much.

They work so well. You put them on under your eyes after washing and drying your face. Just leave them on for 10-15 minutes and when you remove them you gently massage the product into the skin. That's it!<br />The one thing that isn't so great is that they are so hard to separate when you first open the packet and take them out. They stick together and to themselves and it's very frustrating trying to get them without losing the liquid and getting yourself all covered in it. Other than that these are a definite win.", "label": 1}
{"text": "My husband put this kit to good use so I asked him if he'd mind letting me know what he thought about it.

I personally don't use hair pomade or those light shave creams. I prefer foam and my hair just sort of keeps my head warm.<br />Aside from the items I can't use there are some great items in here for everyone. The body scrub soap like and feel a good bit more fresh after using it. But my preference, and where I really came to appreciate this, was with the facial moisturizer and lip balm. I don't usually buy those items and let the winter have its way with my face. I ride a bike everyday. But using the items in this kit really helped me keep my skin from drying, and my lips.

It seems odd to give a five star to something with a scent that isn't quite one that is liked but this is a very good face wash and I absolutely love how clean it leaves my face feeling.

{"text": "This shampoo and conditioner leaves hair feeling clean, soft, and manageable after the first use. It smells nice, too, which is also a plus!<br />My hair is not that of a teen or even young adult anymore so it's been through a lot. When looking for shampoo and conditioning products I tend to look closer at those that claim to make hair stronger, reduce breakage, and things with words like \"restore\" and \"fortify\". These hit the mark so I decided to give them a shot.<br />I've been using them about three weeks and I think that they are definitely doing my hair some good. It looks healthy and feels very soft. The conditioner does a good job with tangles and knots. I do sometimes still use a leave in conditioner or separate type of moisture just because it's winter my hair is increasingly dry on any given day depending. I can't tell for sure about the breakage but it does seem stronger. I suppose in many ways they go hand in hand. It has more pull to it so it's not snapping and breaking as much.<br />I like this. A little goes a long way as well which is nice.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of this one. It didn't do much to help my lips. Rather than exfoliate it actually just seemed to dry out my lips and not just a little bit. It wasn't fun. I tried it a few times, as directed. Just apply a small pea-sized amount to the lips using a finger-tip, scrub gently in a circular motion to remove the dead skin cells for about 30 seconds then rinse or eat off remaining sugar. All of that was done, rinsed not eaten though the one thing that was good was that it didn't taste half bad. Alas, my poor lips were left in worse shape than ever. Dry and roughed up. No matter how hard or gentle I used the stuff over a three week period. I finally gave up and had to admit defeat. Perhaps others had better luck?", "label": 0}
{"text": "This mask is very nice. I have never used a mask like this one before. It's heavier than the usual thin almost paper or gel like masks that a lot of them seem to be. This one definitely has a bit more to it. It's also a two piece mask which is great in some ways because sometimes I looks like a one person comedy routine trying to get the masks on right while they flip and flop all over.<br />With this mask you put the bottom part then the top by your eyes, it makes it a lot easier. Then you leave it on for at least 20 minutes ( though it says to leave it on for 30 so I did that). When you take it off you gently pat the left over into your skin.<br />It leaves your skin feeling so soft and really well moisturized. I feel like it did a very nice job with firming up the skin as well. I have only used two of these so far, one a week over two weeks, and have really liked the way my skin looked and felt after each use. I would recommend giving these a try if you can. Perhaps in summer as they have a nice cooling feel to them that I bet would feel great in the summer heat!", "label": 1}
{"text": "(3.5)<br />Beautiful scrunchies. These scrunchies are very nice. They are made from 100% real natural raw mulberry silk. What makes these special is that they are not supposed to pull your hair as much or get stuck like many others do. That is true of these! The scrunchie works great. It goes in nicely, holds the hair back, doesn't slide out, and when it's taken out there is little to no hair caught in it.<br />However, I can't really see that the price for one is a great one. This is something you have to sort of weigh the options out though for yourself. I have noticed less hair pulling and loss with this hair thing, but the cost is up there. It's a good scrunchie but it's truly up to you if you'd spend that much on one. Maybe the other options make the prices seem less daunting?", "label": 1}

It leaves you soft and refreshed as well as incredibly relaxed.<br />This is a big jar as well that you get and it's worth it for the price.

Hard to fit every finger when the nails are different sizes.<br /><br />And, we\u2019re NOT all sized the same. Hence why some packaging is no less than 24 nails with 12 sizes. I know because I\u2019ve bought nails like this for YEARS! Just look up KISS and you\u2019ll see what I am talking about.<br /><br />This?<br /><br />Was this a joke?

That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with \u2013 and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being \u201cfake\u201d, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic. See how the salons do them, look on Google (or your favorite search engine).<br /><br />Who thought this was a great idea? And, these HAVE to be the LARGEST sizes for the particular \u201cnails\u201d I\u2019ve seen. These really are a fancier version of the Lee and Wet N\u2019 Wild from the late 1980\u2019s/early 1990\u2019.<br /><br />What\u2019s worse? Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I\u2019ll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep \u2013 they\u2019re pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I\u2019d need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price \u2013 I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn\u2019t have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them.

The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place.

Then I waited... and waited... and waited. Since I was reviewing the product I wanted to make sure I waited the full 10 mins to give it a chance. I was out of stuff to wash and shave after about 3 min so the last 7 were pretty boring. In the future I will probably only wait 5 min. I didn't apply any other conditioner other than my normal heat protector I spritz onto towel dried hair. Blow-dried as usual and the results let me skip the flat iron.<br /><br />I was pretty please.

Because of the heaviness and intense moisturizing, I believe that mature skin is going to benefit most from using this.<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s, in a dry climate, with combination skin (T Zone) and some wrinkles as a point of concern.<br />This cream works very well with all of the above. I don't put it on my nose, of course, but when I feel like a splurge I put it on my hands because it's so moisturizing.<br />The claim that it moisturizes 24/7 is indeed true.

Include your neck if you like.<br />Then with each passing moment, it's going to get foamier and foamier. That's why you have to have a very thin coat. You only need a small amount of product. If you use too much, your face is going to foam up like you have shaving cream all over!<br /><br />After about 5 or 10 minutes, you massage a little bit with warm water and then rinse. After you dry your face it's going to feel squeaky clean. If you have dry skin, you're ready for a moisturizing serum and cream.

I don't feel that this mask is drying, but it does leave you very clean.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this is good for all skin types, as long as you use it as a brightening mask as opposed to a hydrating mask.<br />This is just what your skin needs if you have overdosed on hot humid weather.please look at the ingredients to see if you have any sort of allergy or if any of them are a trigger for any skin issues. Because I have sensitive skin that can be triggered, but I only left it on for about 4 minutes. I had absolutely no irritation, but I think if I had left it on longer, I might have. That doesn't mean it's bad for you.

{"text": "Feathers can be a little controversial. Rest assured that these are cruelty free! I used to have a peacock as a pet. He shed those beautiful tail feathers every year, and even though he is long gone I still have some of his gorgeous plumes. Peacock feathers are not harvested from the animal, you simply pick them up as they are naturally shed.<br />This set arrived in a plastic bag. When I pulled the pieces out, there were three peacock feather pieces and one headband. Each feather piece has a rhinestone accent at the bottom. One is all rhinestone, one is a pearl surrounded by rhinestones, and one is a London blue stone surrounded by rhinestones.<br />Of the two larger pieces, one has an alligator clip hot glued onto the felt backing, and one has a strip of grossgrain ribbon glued to the back. Although I'm not sure, I suspect that it was at one time glued to the headband, or they leave it to the consumer to glue it to the headband. I tried to push the end of the headband through the middle of the ribbon, thinking that perhaps it could slide on, but it is glued completely, you can't slide it onto the headband.<br />The smaller piece also has an alligator type clip of the same size as the larger clipped piece. They stay beautifully in your hair and are actually comfortable.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this a glamor or fashion accessory set, it's definitely a costume set that would be great for a roaring twenties party. Each one would also be a fun addition to a hat. I wear a lot of hats and love to adorn them with scarves and feathers.<br /><br />The following is not part of my review but it is a kind of funny peacock story. naturally, when guests came over they wanted to see him with his tail spread out in beautiful peacock glory. They only open up like that when they're trying to impress someone, and he certainly was never impressed by any of my guests. At the time I also had a miniature pig. That peacock was so in love with the pig that whenever she came near him he would spread out his feathers and shake them hoping she would notice and return his love. Of course that never happened, the pig could care less. But whenever we wanted to show him off to our friends, we would walk the pig over to him and he would immediately open his tail feathers with a great flourish! My friends and I were all impressed.

Now that I am past the age that she was at that time, I confess I found myself on the hunt for the perfect pedicure items for those of us prone to alligator feet! Forget the ped-egg, it stays sharp for about a minute. Real women use blades! Caution, go lightly the first time, and always on WELL SOAKED tootsies. Less is more, a bit of callus is supposed to on our feet. Turn the double edged blade around for the second foot, then toss it, never use more than once. Buying them like this is the cheapest way to go. These are great quality blades at a great price.", "label": 1}

What a time saver! It does a fantastic job. It delivers a better shave than my really high-$ screen shaver.<br /><br />6 heads is an improvement over 5. First, it simply covers more area. This is your head ---> a spheroid with protuberances. The 6-head shaver conforms to stuff like your ears and jawline better. 6-heads get the cutter closer to the nooks and crannies where those obnoxious thickets of long hairs might survive for a couple of days before someone points and say, \"Ewee!\"<br /><br />The shaver is small and easy to hold. A charge lasts more than a month. Cleaning is easy. I use shaving cream to lubricate, just like a regular razor. A 'dry' shave in the shower might sound like an oxymoron, but you'll know what I mean when you use it once.<br /><br />I'm sold. Adds at least 5-minutes of goof-off time in my morning routine.

The SOGUE comes with like a year's supply of brushes, unlike the super mega-brand. They are just a tad softer than I prefer. It took me some years to technically discriminate my preferred bristle adjective (soft, medium, hard) for re-order. My brush changing rule is 'new brush for every recharge' as brushes are now so inexpensive. The charges on these toothbrushes have got to be the longest-lasting rechargeable device in the house. It seems like months go by on a charge.<br /><br />4. The SOGUE and brush are about a quarter smaller. It's a noticeable difference. After a minute of thought, I think smaller is likely better as your teeth and the spaces in between are much smaller than you think. Maybe it's getting in tighter corners.<br /><br />5. The SOGUE charges in like 2 hours vs. overnight for the super mega-brand.<br /><br />I was looking at the super mega-brand's newest models at the big-box store. The price is absurd given all the competition from suppliers like SOGUE. The latest super mega-brand models appear the same size as the SOGUE.

However, I tend to agree with them that half the bag was not quite enough and when the bath was full, I couldn't really smell the fragrance anymore with just half the bag.<br /><br />That said, even with just half the bag, I could feel the detoxifying qualities and after the bath I rinsed off well in the shower to remove any of the toxins that had come out through my skin.<br /><br />The sharp, rough rose quartz gem that was included was a bit of a surprise.

{"text": "Desktop Pro 2019 upgraded smoothly and easily with absolutely no issues. I began by backing up my QuickBooks desktop Pro 2018, and then began the installation process. It went smoothly and quickly and didn't take very long. I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br /><br />The part that was awful was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things. Luckily I was aware of this so when simply entering the information into QuickBooks didn't work, I knew that I was in for a phone call. About 45 minutes later of being on hold and trying to be up sold on QuickBooks online by an Indian tech-support person (hey guys, I just got desktop Pro 2019 upgraded, please don't sell me on QuickBooks online), I was good to go.<br /><br />I think it's absolutely offensive that after you've purchased a software product like this they make you call in as a matter of course to activate. Anybody using this product is either being paid by the hour or runs a business and does not have that kind of spare time to sit around wasting on a process that should be 30 seconds of data entry.<br /><br />I have multiple employees and so end up paying an additional 4 to 8 dollars per month for the subscription to add additional employees. It's another two dollars a month per employee after the first one. Also, be aware that the setting is set to subscribe you to an annual payroll subscription, which if done through QuickBooks will cost you about $420. Purchasing the new upgrade of desktop Pro 2019 with the payroll for a year costs less than that, so being automatically billed such a high amount for just the payroll is offensive and ridiculous.<br /><br />I would really like QuickBooks as a company to reconsider how they deal with their payroll subscriptions and activation of payroll that has already been purchased, because this is a huge problem that is been garnering them poor reviews and lots of bad press for some time. I personally have considered many times changing to a more congenial company just to avoid this particular dance every single year. Do I pay $420 to avoid being on the phone for 45 minutes with somebody from India who act like I've done something terribly wrong by purchasing my payroll upgrade on Amazon along with the software upgrade? Or do I do as I have done most years and purchase the yearly upgrade that comes with the enhanced payroll.<br /><br />As an FYI, the enhanced payroll really does make it very easy to run your quarterly reports and do your e-filing. I did it myself for many years, but now hand the file back and forth to my bookkeeper via email as a portable file.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This was relatively easy to use and had OK results. Context: my hair is dark dark brown at the root, but I have fashion colors that have faded. The previous color was blue, but part of it faded into various shades of brown, so the underlying color is a little bit uneven. Having said that, because this cream is not very opaque, you can see a lot of the underlying color beneath, so if you are trying to cover anything, this isn\u2019t going to do a great job.<br />The product pictures definitely don\u2019t match the results regardless. Unless you have very light blonde hair, this is only going to provide grayish highlights. That is even taking into account the fact that I was quite generous with this cream. This is the first time I\u2019ve tried a product like this, so I\u2019m not sure how the other brands do, but this was just OK for me.

Once the liquid is on, you press the strip onto your face and then wait. It dries quicker than other pore strips I've used. After a little more than 5 minutes it was ready to peel. After peeling I looked at the strip and I could see the little hairs and stuff that came out of my skin. My nose feels smoother and looks clear.

The big clumps of bubbles will pop and flatten on your face and when most of them were popped I wet my hands and rubbed the mask on my face.

The way it opens leaves my hand too close to the heat which results in easily getting burned. Which isn't a problem if you wear the glove... but being honest, I'm not going to use a heat shield glove every day to do my hair. I only use one of these **sometimes** when I am using a curling wand. So for me that is a huge con. It also comes with two hair clips to help separate the sections of your hair. For the price...

{"text": "I am always in need of a good curling iron and this one is okay but it is a little bigger than I would like for it to be. I really love all the settings this one has. This has two buttons that control the temperature up or down and it has a little window to show what the current temp is. The maximum temperature is 350 and it reaches that rather quickly. It has a switch that controls the speed of the twirl low or fast. Then there is a button to control the direction you want to curl your hair left or right and it has a home button to return the iron to the correct home position. This has a flipper that is about an inch to start your twirl but it leaves crease marks in your hair that cannot be corrected unless you re-wet it and start all over. It really needed a heat resistant glove because no matter how skilled you are at this you are going to try and wrap your hair with your hand so it is a high probability of user error which will probably result in a burn. This is a really nice gray and white. I do like this curling iron it just has a few hiccups.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I think these are a great idea.  I need to practice more with it and adjust the size of the lashes.  My initial attempts were a little messy and it is strange having the weight on your lids.  I never could get the hang of the glue on lashes, so I was hoping these were easier.  If you regularly use liquid liner, these will be easy for you to use.  The hardest part is getting the liner on smooth and straight.  Once it is on, the lashes stick very well to the magnetic bits in the liner.  Also, they come off fairly easily when pulled.  Potentially, it means you could accidentally pull them off if you play with your lashes or rub your eyes.  But they do stay on well, without touching.<br /><br />The lashes are a standard length, so if your eyes are smaller or larger than standard, you may have to adjust - more for smaller than larger.  If you've never worn lashes but have always wanted to try, this is a good way to start.", "label": 1}

However, based on the picture of 3 stacked lips that appears in the item description, I was looking for a result similar to the center one (or top one if you are looking at the lower photo that appears above the reviews), especially given that my skin color is close to the skin of that model, but on me, the color looks more like it does in the bottom photo, with a slightly more orange-y hue.

They have a wet, silicone-like feel that is very similar to the feel of a contact lens, only thicker. I found that they stuck to my skin fairly well, even when I was moving around.

{"text": "I love trying different lotions, particularly those that have nice fragrance, but when I received this set, I almost threw it away!  I the bottle, the smell of the lotion is horrible - I found it to have a strong, artificial scent similar to alcoholic spirits.  I decided to give it a try so that I could write an accurate review.  The \"lotion\" is quite thin, much more watery than any other moisturizer I have used.  Just to spread on my elbows requires at least 10 pumps from the tiny bottle.  The good news is that once on the skin, the distasteful fragrance does not last; I didn't really detect much scent at all after that, but there may have been a faint hint of rose in the dry-down.  The moisturization was adequate, nothing more.<br /><br />I do like the Nail & Cuticle Oil, which comes in a little roller bottle and actually DOES have a rose scent.  But this set is absolutely NOT worth the cost, especially given that the lotion is likely to be completely gone after just a few weeks of daily use.  Not recommended.<br /><br />NOTE:  At least one other reviewer (\"Jam Blaster\") mentioned the same issue with the lotion smelling bad and gave this product just 1-star as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/1/21:<br />Since I don't like the scent of this product, I decided to try it on my feet.  Despite the lotion being very thin, I actually found it to work quite well on my feet!  I put it on in the a.m., then put on socks; by the end of the day, my feet definitely felt soften and smoother.  I think the product is too expensive to purchase for this reason alone, but it does work, and so I increased my rating to 3-star.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have been using this product for several weeks now.  I choose the option for the \"mascara brush\" style, as I thought this might be easier to use than the thin brush styles I've tried in the past.  My results with this were mixed.  First, the product is barely discernible on the brush!  It seems only completely dry; more product gets on the wand part than on the brush end.  Second, the brush is plastic and feels VERY harsh; a brush with soft bristles might have been better.<br /><br />That being said, this product has seemed to help my lashes somewhat.  The effect isn't very noticeable with bare lashes, but when I use mascara, my lashes do look thicker and longer than they would normally.  I have used this product on my eyebrows too and have seen some improvement there as well.  I wish this was a little easier to use; I would rate it about three and a half stars.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This lipstick set comes in 2 sets of 5, Set A and Set B.  I wound up only opening the \"A\" set, as after trying these 5 and finding only 2 to work for me, I decided to give the \"B\" set away.  From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case.  The color I am wearing in the photo is \"Almost Friday,\" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink.  I also kept \"Blush for Me,\" a light, brownish peach.  The red shade, \"Red for Me,\" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection.  But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos.  Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note.  When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality.  Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off.  This might be good for some who carry around lipsticks in a bag, but for quick everyday use, it's annoying.", "label": 1}

I will use this but I won't repurchase.", "label": 1}
{"text": "My eyelashes are thin, sparse, and short (like my hair, haha).  I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!  But you can also see that while my lashes are longer, they are still pretty thin/sparse.  Given this, I think this product would work best for those who have thicker but short lashes.", "label": 1}
{"text": "NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product to review.<br /><br />Like the hair on my head, my eyelashes are thin and fine.  Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.", "label": 1}
{"text": "After very minimal and barely noticeable success with whitening toothpastes and gels, I finally decided to give Crest Premium Whitestrips a try.  Previously, I had found the cost to be prohibitive, but the fact that $5 or $7 coupons are offered in our Sunday paper with some regularity made the price a bit easier to swallow.<br /><br />Just like the commercials say, I definitely did begin to see some improvement after about three days.  I would describe the effect as more of a lightening than a whitening per se:  the darker yellow spots on my teeth began to fade and to become less apparent.  Now, after using the product as prescribed for a week, the color of my teeth is clearly improved; I wouldn't say that my teeth are bright white, but they are definitely more of an ivory or a paler yellow color.  According to the package insert, you can immediately begin a second course of treatment for even better whitening effects, but I haven't yet decided if I want to lay out another $30 in order to do this.  Also, I should mention that the effect is not so dramatic thta anyone has noticed (UNLIKE in the commercials!).<br /><br />Now for the caveats.  First of all, I found these strips to be a bit difficult to use.  It can be hard to remove the strips from the protective backing without them becoming mangled, and it is very easy to get the gel on your fingertips (which causes a temporary whitening effect).  Also, the strips are not ideally shaped for your mouth, and I found that they covered my front eight teeth only.  Finally, while the top strip adhered fairly well, I found that the bottom strip was more tricky and tended to slide around, especially if I moved my mouth at all.  The only solution I found to this was to wear the strips while commuting to work, which luckily gave me a 30-minute period when I did not need to talk.  Otherwise, it can be difficult to find a good time to wear the strips, as the insert information advises against wearing them immediately after you brush your teeth, while sleeping, and while you are eating/drinking.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the taste of the strips:  I could not detect anything while wearing them, and after taking them off, I thought that the gooey paste left behind was virtually tasteless.  I did experience some sensitivity in a lower tooth which I had capped over 20 years ago.  Although this sensation went away in time, it was uncomforable enough to make me cut the lower strip to fit around this particular tooth.<br /><br />In summary, I did see clear--although not miraculous--results from this product and I would be willing to try the strips again, especially if the price were to come down a bit.  Ultimately, I would rate Crest Whitestrips three and a half stars, as there is definitely room for improvement.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is a DIY clay mask kit that could use better branded packaging. It comes in a generic box with everything tossed into it, which makes it feel like a random assortment of products rather than a unified kit. It includes two different but reputable brands (Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and an Indian Clay Mask) as well as an assortment of mixing supplies (pink bowl, measuring spoons, spatula, brush). The pink plastic supplies are dollar quality and feel very cheap while the ACV and clay mask are full size products that can be used together as indicated on the DIY recipe or on their own. The mask jar doesn't specify that ACV must be used so I assume you can use it on your own or have it diluted with water. The ACV can be used for many other applications including drinking for general health.<br /><br />Overall I like the quality of the two products - the other supplies felt unnecessary and extraneous, but I guess you can charge more by including them. But I'd rather just use my own bowls. Overall it's a good quality kit and it gives you a nice at-home facial. I tried it once and my skin does look brighter than usual.

The bottle is filled with tiny \"pearls\" suspended in a gel solution that reminds me of bubble tea. The serum that comes out is supposedly infused with fermented pearl extract. In Asia, eternal beauty is often represented by pearls and so they're attributed with some mystical powers of youthful rejuvenation and powers of preservation. So it goes with this serum - the lotion has a shimmering effect mimicking that of pearls. It is very smooth and creamy, and leaves my skin glowing.<br /><br />Whether this serum has actual anti-aging effects is questionable. My wrinkles haven't gone away at all.

{"text": "This \"facial kit\" has all the items you'd expect to get in a spa gift basket, only it's shipped in a cardboard box reminiscent of subscription boxes. The main difference is that it's a one-time deal, no subscription needed, and all the items are grouped together by theme and color. I ordered the \"gold\" theme and was a little disappointed that not all the items are gold colored (the eye mask is blue) and there's a mix of drugstore items with some more luxurious feeling ones.<br /><br />I'll start with the good. The box is very cute, with the words \"It's a great day to love your face\" greeting you when you open the box. Inside you get a five count box of sheet Masks that contain retinol, a generous and thick box of facial wipes, a Gold under-eye pad to reduce lines and puffiness, and a gold Lip Mask (I've never used a \"lip mask\" before so this seems a little bizarre, if fun). The blue eye mask is filled with gel beads so you can use it hot or cold, and the cheapest and least impressive items are the \"facial buff\" (a pear-shaped sponge that looks like something you'd clean your pots with) and a  \"facial cleansing brush\" that looks a little cheap but is nevertheless useful.<br /><br />The main thing that was missing was some packing peanuts or confetti, as the items were tossed into the box hither and thither with NO padding, whereas other gift baskets and boxes typically include some stuffing so that the items are more artfully displayed. This one wasn't, so if I were giving this to someone as a gift, I'd certainly add it so the items wouldn't arrive in a jumble. But otherwise, I liked it.", "label": 1}

Except for this, I love the look of this nail polish.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I love gift sets like these, which are great for sampling expensive beauty products so that you don't waste money on full size products that don't work for your skin. This is the secret behind the success of Ipsy and Birchbox. You get five travel sizes of the most popular and bestselling items sold by Caudalie: an eye cream, radiance serum, moisturizing sorbet, foaming cleanser, and beauty elixer. The eye cream was nice but I didn't see any effect on my wrinkles; the radiance serum made my skin feel great, as did the moisturizing sorbet. I think I liked the cleanser the most and the beauty elixer the least (it didn't do much for me). Considering that each one is costly for a full size version, it's great to be able to know which one is right for me before purchasing. To top it off, it comes in a beige canvas cosmetic travel bag decorated with grapes. Very nice.", "label": 1}

She dislikes the scent (very medicinal) but she feels refreshed after wiping herself with one of these. Each one is individually sealed which is convenient and hygienic, versus those where you have a resealable package and risk drying out the other towels if it's not sealed properly. I will also use these when I go hiking or camping. They are biodegradable so it's also better for the environment. Recommended.", "label": 1}

However, if you only do so occasionally, you might find that the size of this pillow might be a deterrent. It's not space saving and does take up a lot of room for storage. That would be my only critique.", "label": 1}
{"text": "UPDATED Review:<br />I took off one star because the tips of my nails turned yellow (and stayed that way for a few days) after using this product. Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br /><br />Previously:<br />These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed out as much product as I could, I still had leftover polish on the edges of my fingers. Not wanting to waste a whole other cloth to finish the job, I blotted the remainder using a cotton ball and my usual polish remover.<br /><br />Overall, it's strong and will remove most of your polish, but the cost of this product is higher than if you stocked up on a few bottles of nail polish remover and used cotton balls. But if you're traveling, it would definitely be  more convenient and I suppose that's what you're be paying for. But be prepared to use 2 cloths at a time to get it all off, which adds up to only 5 uses.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I just came back from a trip and packed this curling iron in my luggage. It's described as \"travel\" but the length is about the same as other curling irons. The main difference is the weight - it's so light and functions as both a straightener and curler, so it does save space in my luggage. It works very well. I had never heard of this brand before but the curler works just as well as more expensive brands. To change from a curler to a straightener, you simply press the buttons \"S\" for Straightener or \"C\" for Curling! So simple and easy to use.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I love the scent of this anti-aging serum but I didn't notice any significant effects on the wrinkle beneath my right eye. In addition, the microbeads don't dissolve easily and I had to rub the serum several times before they were absorbed by my face.

So I won't be ordering any more products with this ingredient.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Jade facial rollers are everywhere these days and it's hard to find one that stands out among the crowded field of rollers. This set contains a beautiful rose pink quarter roller with two tiny bottles containing quartz crystals. I love the bottles but the downside is absolutely no instructions are given as how to use them. If you add essential oils, you usually need a carrier oil (like coconut) because they are not good for your skin if applied directly. I'm not sure how the crystals would mitiate this or not, as they're just little rocks. As a result, I'm not sure how to use these.<br /><br />The roller itself, however, is of good quality and I've been using it frequently. I would get it for the roller alone, but the lack of instructions prevent me from giving this set more than three stars.", "label": 1}

The mist seemed to make it a little bit softer and smoother, but not to the point where I'd get this again. I prefer to use other anti-frizz products because I can't get past the slight vinegar smell. Add in the high price and I'm not getting it again.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This flat iron is versatile in that it's effective on dry hair as well as wet - usually I avoid straightening my hair when it's dry out of fear that it will damage my hair. In this case I didn't notice any ill after effects - the Tourmaline Ceramic plates are designed to be softly reactive to your hair, so this may be the reason. The best advice I can give is to be aware of the heat settings - I typically use the lowest and work my way up depending on how my hair reacts.<br /><br />Like most flat irons by Parwin, it heats up fast and has a swivel cord. Given how many flat irons there are on the market, I would say this is OK in terms of what it does for the price. I wouldn't say it was exceptional but I like the versatility of the dry hair option.", "label": 1}

Most of them shimmer with glitter, which is really cool - you can mix and match the different colors to get just the right effect.

A courtesy card from the company thanking you for purchasing the product even includes a quote about how great mothers are from singer Stevie Wonder!<br /><br />Overall this is a very useful product that will save a parent money from taking your little one to the barber shop or hair salon. It works well and I can't see why it can't be used for an adult's hair as well, though the small size made it clear that is meant for a child's small head.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a nice set of six nail polishes, all in identical black bottles. I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would have been faster.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and I like the glossy finish. There hasn't been any serious chipping or loss of polish for a week now, but I've used other gel polishes that have lasted almost as long as the LED kind.  And for those who like to change their polish often, preserving the same look for a week or two isn't a priority. So unlike you already have some sort of LED lamp, I would just stick to the normal gel polishes available out there.", "label": 1}

I used a little water and my usual Aveeno moisturizer with SPF 15 sunblock.  My face does look a little brighter after using it for a week but the effect is somewhat similar to using a light-colored makeup foundation.  Unfortunately it has little effect on my crow's-feet or my small &quot;laugh lines&quot;. It's OK but since I can get the same effect applying certain types of makeup or concealers, it's chief benefit is that it's good to use when you don't want to wear makeup and want something that has a lighter feel on your face. Otherwise, the price is kind of high for what you get.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Rub a Dub Scrub! A delightful shower treat. This organic body polish is nicely scented with coffee and peppermint. Typically I make my own from organic ingredients, so I am picky and compare. I was very happy with the Alexa coffee body scrub. The package is a nice size at 8 oz. It also would make a wonderful gift if you are needing a quality pampering for someone.<br /><br />You can just get your feet wet if you are doing a pedicure with it. All you have to do is get your body wet, or the particular area you are using it on. I put a smidgen between my fingers and only use it on key body dry areas. If you want to slather it all over that is ok too! I just like to make it last because it is nice on my skin. I have several dry eczema areas and dry areas on my feet.<br /><br />I have used other brands and had to transfer it into another container of my own, I love that with this one I didn't have to! It is not to cumbersome in the shower, the package is easy to open and close. The Alexa brand is made in the USA with organic all natural moisturizers. My skin is soft silky smooth with the combination of the great ingredients of dead sea salt, organic oils, organic coffee and organic shea butter. I used the scrub on my hands, feet, upper arms and legs. The scrub doesn't leave behind an oily residue, just a nice soft skin feeling. It's great for light exfoliating. Scrub, rub and rinse!

{"text": "Things I learned:<br />-DO NOT over massage<br />-Use the cream properly<br />-Use the massager properly<br />-use the cream right after. These products come in a pair for a reason.<br /><br />Alright, I'll get to the point. Does the product do what it says?<br />In so many words, yes, most definitely.<br />My experience with the products was as follows.<br />First, I mistakenly used the cream on my legs during my shower as a way of lubricating the massager.<br /><br />TIP: This is incorrect... I know that now.<br /><br />Luckily, I din't waste much and my experience with the brush was actually really great. Massaging is painless and since its manual, you get to choose the level of pressure you feel you ought to apply.<br />One caveat--do not over rub. I did so and ended up bursting my bum, waking up the following morning with bits of--what I assume was--busted blood cells. I even bruised a bit. Long story short, go easy on yourself and do not massage too often. I would suggest about four times a week as a maximum.<br /><br />The cream itself is nice. I've used it about 5 times now, and I can already so a minor difference. Although I generally attribute this to the massager, the cream does leave the skin feeling tighter for sure. It does remain sticky for a couple of seconds (about 45...less than a minute, not bad) but drys completely.<br /><br />My experience has taught me that, by using the correct products correctly, you can actually get rid of cellulite.<br /><br />Last and final point; I'm not sure how permanent this is, however, massaging and creaming really isn't that much of a hassle.

It didn't look natural anymore and it was clumpy, etc. If you want a product to add some grey strands to your hair this is great. If you want to look 100% grey, this won't do it for you. I was surprised by the shininess of it when I opened it, but when it went on it really looked very natural.<br /><br />**If you found this review helpful, please click the \u2018Helpful\u2019 button below.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I\u2019ve used many different eye creams in the past. In choosing to take a chance on this one I was literally<br />shocked at what I witnessed upon applying this under my eyes. I wake with puffy eyes, semi wrinkles coming in at age 50. After cleansing my face I turn to this to work it\u2019s magic. It only takes a very small amount to apply. I\u2019ve never used the word shocked in a review but what I saw within a 2 minute period did just that. The area under my eyes instantly smoothed out & looked as if I had skin of a 20yo again. The longer I let it sit before applying my serum & moisturizer the more smoothing & softened the area became. This isn\u2019t a harsh eye cream. I had no stinging, no bad reaction, it worked perfectly for my skin. There\u2019s no scent to it. It comes nicely out of the dispenser. The smoothed & tightened area that I\u2019ve clearly noticed remains this way even after the rest of my facial regime. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before with truly how rapid it works on my skin upon applying. This morning I used it & moisturized my face only. What an amazing difference that again has lasted. Rapid Reduction it definitely is. A 1 ounce tube will last me awhile since a little goes a long way. Genuine quality with this cream & I highly recommend it. You\u2019ll see the results!", "label": 1}

{"text": "Elizabeth Mott $et for Life Loose Setting Powder is the 1st type of powder that has kept my oily skin under control all day long. It\u2019s a light powder that comes out of the container through little holes so I have control over how much powder I want in the top of the container where I pick up the powder with my makeup brush. The design is wonderful. It\u2019s sheer & applies nicely with my discretion. It\u2019s the last product I put on my face in the morning. I don\u2019t wear foundation or any of that. After cleansing I use toner (not everyday) then my moisturizer with sunscreen & primer. Finally I\u2019m complete this great face setting powder. I\u2019ve never found anything that keeps my face in place before I found this. Hours later no oil can be seen on my face~and my skin is oily! Late afternoon I may use the face blotting tissues to set my face more, depending on where/what I\u2019m doing. Even then little oil shows through. In the past I\u2019ve used a matte powder which worked but not as good as this. My skin color would be considered beige in the matte powder so I was hesitant on this \u201cTranslucent\u201d color but it blends in wonderfully. I don\u2019t look too pale or too dark. I love it!

{"text": "This mirror is a blessing to have.  It is a great addition to my makeup vanity.  I love the way it looks just to sit out for decoration.<br />Mirror is light weight yet the base is heavy.  The mirror does turn over to have normal side then to flip it is magnified.  The best part of this mirror is it is LED illuminated.  It took 3 AA batteries which were supplied.  The toggle switch is on the base and when illuminated it gives that cool glow.  I love plucking my eyebrows with this mirror.  Easy to see and with the added light it works well.  The light is very vibrant and puts off a very nice glow.  Lights are on both sides.<br />I would consider all materials high quality by the apperance and by the weight.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely satisfied with this dual sided mirror.  It has been a great item added to my makeup collection.  Works well to sit on the vanity to give you an additional mirror for up close application and for the magnification.  I am not sure how I have lived my 32 years without a mirror like this to apply my makeup or pluck my eyebrows.<br /><br />I received this mirror for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

{"text": "This is a good set of contouring colors.  It has a huge range of colors needed for dark skin, to light skin, It even includes a white cream for highlighting along with some green and pinks to even out skin tone.  Basically this set is a great set to start with and to have on hand for when your skin goes thru some funky changes.  We all have that happen from time to time.  Anyways my contouring kit is a cream set of 15 colors.  Each color is very creamy and I had no issues with blending and rubbing in.  However I always use a high quality primer with all makeup so that may add to the easy technique of blending into the mixture.  Each color has its advantages along with its disadvantages.  Like I said not every color is going to suit your needs so If you are looking for specific colors this is not the set for you, this is a range of colors for different shades of skin.<br />The makeup seemed to be long wearing but please dont forget that I used primer and that could have something to do with makeup wear length.  I also did not break out with this cream as I have done with so many other colors.  Of course I made sure to clean my face off each evening and I never slept in it at all.  The plastic holding the makeup tins is a hard black plastic,  I wouldnt call it super high quality but its not the cheapest I have come across.  The reason for 4 stars is because I prefer mirrors in the compact as sometimes I like to have my makeup in hand while applying and it would be nice if a mirror was included.  However it takes no value away from the makeup its just my personal preference.  I also need to research some of these ingredients,  (which I havent done as of yet while writing the review)  I have not recongized a couple and usually most ingredients I am somewhat familiar with as I am a makeup fanatic.  Nothing jumps out and screams do not put on your face though.  I also wish the ingredients was listed on the hard plastic case so once you dispose of the box which everyone does you still have a list of ingredients in case you have some delayed reaction after long term use.  Another reason for 4 stars.  However overall I am pleased with this makeup palette.  It seems to be well suited for a starter pack for those learning to contour, and those whose skin goes thru some weird skin tones from time to time.  My only complaints were the ones listed above and no others.  Makeup seems to spread smoothly and blends well.  Which is what most women prefer when it comes to contouring.  I did notice it did take several coats and more during application than what I am used to however compared to regular drug store kits its pretty comparable to it, may be a tad better in quality as it blends easily.<br />I received this makeup palette for free for testing and reviewing purposes,  I have come to this conclusion by using and wearing this makeup for a few days myself.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is such an amazing set of brushes.  These brushes come enclosed in a nice case that has an individual slot holder and a flap that protects the bristles.  The case can then be rolled over and tied for easy carrying and storage for your brushes.  I have used all of these brushes and found that each brush seems to be soft bristles, and designed to do different makeup applications.  Love each of these brushes.  Although the brushes werent super saturated with makeup, I went a head and washed them to test the durability of the bristles.  Once washed with a mild brush wash they dried nicely and the bristles remained soft and I had no fibers falling out of the brush.  Each brush handle is wood and painted pink.  Love the girly factor.  Handles fit in my hand well and I had no issues with makeup application..<br />I received a beauty sponge.  It worked well with liquid foundation application ( just remember to wet and squeeze the water out of it before using) the sponge is super absorbent so if not wet it will absorb the makeup just like any beauty sponge.<br />This sponge is nice and soft and washed up well also.<br />Overall I am very satisfied with this set of brushes.  Bristles are soft and provide great makeup application.

As I can fill it in no time.  There are different slots for different brushes.  It holds the brushes well and in place and I think because of them being upside down makes them dry faster and help hold their shape.

I was incredibly excited to try this product out after seeing the buzzfeed video with them using it.<br />When I first opened the package, I was a bit shocked at how big of a bottle it was but how it seemed like barely half was full. When attempting to squeeze is out it was very much like trying to get the last of a product out of a container just as you're about to run out of it. All air, very little inside.<br />I did a small test area just to see if there was any kind of crazy reaction and I didn't have any issues. Goes on, peels off, wash away any little flakes that don't peel with it. However, when I went back to do a full mask I noticed that even though I had totally sealed it up tight, within about 20 minutes a massive amount of the product had leaked into the lid. I cleaned it up so it didn't solidify and placed the bottle upside down, so the lid was facing up instead.<br />The full mask itself went on nice and easy, just like the test. When I peeled it off, I did notice my skin felt fresher but it didn't really pull anything out. I checked the peeled off mask itself and while it had plenty of little itty bitty hairs from my face, nothing really noticeable. I checked out problem areas in the mirror and they looked basically the same, maybe with some blackheads and things closer to the surface and drawn up so they could be removed. The effect was minimal though and pretty disappointing.<br />I'll finish it off since there isn't much left and there is no point in not using it, but I won't be buying any more after this.", "label": 0}

I have 3 bottles from 3 different places, 3 different colors (blue white and black) and the blue one is good, the white one is meh, and the black one is completely useless.  The white and black have bent brushes, and the white polish is a bit dried out but not the worst, kind of reminds me of using white-out before they changed the formula and it got all watery and they changed to a sponge applicator from a brush.  The black one is awful - it's literally just clumps of dried out polish with some occasional damp spots.  The blue one is okay, the polish is alright, but I wouldn't recommend using the brushes that came with these but buying a separate skinny brush for line work or whatever it is you want to do.<br /><br />I should mention I have been using them to fix an enameled piece of jewelry as opposed to doing nails, as that's what the jeweler recommended (nobody local repairs enamel resin and buying enamel is very expensive and you end up with a ton leftover), so a jeweler I trust recommended nail polish with a good resin sealant and that's what I've been doing.

A pleasant surprise this second time around is that some of the new growth is coming in my natural black rather than silver or white as it had been.

{"text": "First time in 20 years I've transitioned from a liquid concealer to a powder, the coverage is obviously not the same but this is by far the best performing powder I've ever had. I'm lucky in that my face at it's not-the-most-tan tiny works well with the light color but I can see how the limited color choices can be a deal breaker for some. It's smooth and not cakey, it blends well, feels weightless, and stands up to sweating and long work days with great shine prevention and it doesn't come off easily (a little when you blow your nose etc). I do not like the porcelain doll look and this works well for me for evening out tones.  I am 35 and have very sensitive skin, several minor facial scars, and occasional adult acne and this doesn't have any negative effects on my skin at all. It washes off easily with gentle face wash. It allows for a few spot touches of stick concealer, blends well, and holds well. Mine arrived with no breaks/cracks and the sponge works well. I really like the protective inner plastic case between the powder and the lid and sponge. Will buy again! I previously used Revlon, Covergirl, Neutrogena, and JUNGSAEMMOOL Essential Star-cealer Foundation which I was happy with the first time and then the following two were slimy and just not working well. For reference my current face tone is a revlon 300-310, a covergirl 705-710, and Starcealer Light. After peak summer I'm a more 310-320, 710-715, and Starcealer Medium (almost, its still a little dark for me).", "label": 1}

{"text": "I bought this oil after using their avocado oil. Life-Flo is a great brand. I've never had issues with any of their products. This oil is food grade, cold pressed. It is a lighter weight than their avocado oil, but it works just as well. I use this on my son who is two to help his skin retain moisture (he has severe eczema). I put a cap full in his bath and apply it all over after his bath while he is still damp. His skin is soft and his eczema spots are softer, not as rough, but I still have to apply a layer of Vaseline to his rough patches to keep him from scratching and to keep his spots super moisturized. I use it on his scalp also once a week. I massage it through his hair and let it soak in while he's playing in the tub and I follow it put by shampooing his hair like normal. It absorbs quickly, and I do apply it throughout the day when I change his diaper. It doesn't have a scent to it really, which is a plus since I have to be careful with perfumes with him. It does make your tub slippery if you add it to your bath water, I always clean the tub after his bath to be on the safe side. We usually go through a 12 oz bottle every six months so it lasts a while compared to a gel baby oil (we go through one of them a month if we use it).  A little bit goes a long way. This oil used in conjunction with Vaseline and his prescription meds helps keeps his eczema in check, and I have discovered that we are using his prescription med less since we swapped over to this oil. For us this oil is more effective than coconut, avocado, baby oil, ceteaphil, or aveeno.  If it's for eczema we have tried it. He's had eczema since he was 3 months old and I feel like we finally found a product that I know is safe to use, it's all natural, no chemicals, and it's within budget.", "label": 1}

My husband had warned me of the dangers of using blades, and I've cut my feet several times. I read many reviews on this product and others before purchasing. It came in 2 days and had a charge when it arrived.  I keep it plugged in so it's ready whenever my husband or I are needing to use it. I'm very pleased with this product, and very happy that I purchased this.  It works very well and does a great job, and I use it at least once a week to keep my feet really soft. My husband also uses it about once a week also, to keep his feet smooth.  He was shot in the foot and the bullet fragments are still in his foot, and he gets calluses where the fragments are in his foot. I also purchased the extra rollers, but haven't had to change the original one out yet.  Those who complained about this product must not have used it properly.  When using don't press down thinking that extra pressure will help, it's not designed to be used like that.  Just lightly touch the area you want to treat and the file will definitely work well. For those who have a lot of hard calluses, you might want to either soak your feet first to soften the skin,  or use it everyday for a couple of days until you get the best results.  You don't want to over do it because you may cause your feet to be sore. I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this wonderful gadget to anyone.

{"text": "This Hair Removal Device by Ulike just as well as a couple of other IPL devices I have that cost much less.

The instruction booklet contains about as much as the empty listing page that I ordered it from. That page has no bullet points, only one photo.<br />They do have another listing for this same exact device, showing the accessories, extra photos with bits of information, and bullet points telling a little about it. I got my information from there.<br />The device does have the cooling feature, as many others do, which helps it not to zap too badly. It also comes with a razor and eye protection.<br />What it lacks, that many others include that are in or around this price range, is more attachments for the device. There needs to be at least one smaller light head for use around the lip area, as it's very hard to use the main one with the device being so large.<br />This IPL device works pretty much as well as any other, with none having the ability to make you completely hair-free at any point in the future. As far as the studies that I have seen, with diligent use, home IPL devices can only offer a little better than 50-60%-ish less hair.<br />My preferred device, which costs very little more than this one, has several attachments, including some specifically for skin rejuvenation. You do get a fancy box with this device, and it looks nice, but I don't think it provides any more or less than devices that cost much less.<br />I haven't found one yet that really only takes 10 minutes to do your legs, but if I ever do, that is the one that would probably take the cake!

The clear is really clear and the pink is nice, also, though I don't use colors a lot. This applies so easily for me, cures as expected, and looks great. I am even able to build an apex.<br />The brush and other accessories are sub-par, like what most inexpensive sets have. They will do well for a newbie, until they figure out if they like the process. Then, they can replace them with better quality items.<br />The slip solution is confusing to be in a builder gel kit, though I find it great for wiping the sticky layer off the nails after application. It can also be used to clean the brush handle, and any other sticky places.<br />I am more than happy with the quality, viscosity, and end results I achieve with this builder gel. You also get a large amount of product to work with. It will last me a while. I love working with it, and would definitely recommend it!", "label": 1}

{"text": "I really loved the idea of this Boiess Baby Cologne \"Les Enfants\" in White Blossom. Not because I think it is a good idea for a baby, because boy, is it not. I actually thought it would be perfect for myself since I don't like loud fragrances. The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes. I was able to try both the Lavanda and the White Blossom scents.<br />Both of the \"Cologne\" sprays smell identical to me. I can't say that I can tell them apart at all. They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, much less any baby, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again. If I spray it on a few times over an hour or so, I can smell the ever so slightest hint of it on my clothing later, if I put my nose right on it. That is a lot of spraying for very little payoff.<br />I know this is meant for kids mostly, but I would think the scent would and should last longer. Sure, my grandsons will like using it, maybe or not, as it is quite strong at first. But, I think it would just be more for the fun of it and very short lived.\u00a0This is also very expensive \"Cologne\" to not be able to smell it after 30 minutes, and right at $28 is too expensive for me to buy just for the fun of it. \u00a0<br />For others this \"Baby Cologne\" may be something\u00a0wonderful or maybe they can smell it more than I can. As I said, I really love the idea of a light fragrance, but not for babies. I do wish the scent stuck around more for me.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This is a great sampler set by KRISNICE. You get a black polish to use as a base or on its own, a couple of color changing polishes, a couple of cat eye polishes, and a sparkly red polish. They are all beautiful and the effects all work well. The cat eyes do require a few coats to get good coverage, and a bit of practice with the magnet to get a good design. The good thing about those are, you can always swipe through the design and start over till you get something you like, and then cure. I love the color changing ones the best, but they only show two toned on longer nails. Otherwise, they just change from one color to another, which is still pretty.<br />The huge thing about this company's sets that I don't like, is they are not labeled. Yes, you get stickers to swatch, but they don't stick! You end up having to glue them on or make other swatches. I really wish they would label or swatch the bottles. I'm starting to not get polish from brands that don't label. It's just such a hassle.<br />Overall, I love all the colors and effects. You can really come up with some unique nail designs with this set. I love the color change with one layer of the purple cat eye over top. This is a good mix and a lot of fun!

{"text": "The straight razor (shavette) I received is far from being professional quality nor could it be an heirloom that can be passed down in the family. It is made from cheap materials and has several defects.<br />The clasp is so thinly made, that it is easily bent just from disengaging it from the spine.  There is a gouge on one spine that goes in on one side and out on the other. And, the razor blade does not stay seated properly once clasped. The wooden scales are not neatly finished. The blades that come with it are not the snap kind. They are full double sided blades, making them more dangerous to have to cut them without getting cut. They are also very thin and cheap. There's no way I can shave a neck, sideburns, facial hair, etc., with this defective razor.<br />I could have overlooked cosmetic issues regarding a razor of this price point. It is the physical defects that hindered its use that are major problems for me.<br />I contacted the seller, but was told that I could keep the defective product, and \"we recommend another straight for you, better than that one in your hand\", and I was given the asin number, so I could purchase it. This was not only poor Customer Service, but a lack of confidence in this, their own product. If they don't recommend this razor, I certainly don't either.

{"text": "This Belle polygel kit is a great starter set\u00a0from beginner to expert levels. It has some beautiful neutral colors, along with a white, and gorgeous glitters. They are all half ounce size tubes that will create a few sets of nails each, or you can mix and match the colors to make them go farther.<br />This kit includes; Six .5 oz. polygel colors, primer,\u00a0gel\u00a0base and top coats, a nail strengthener, cuticle oil, slip solution, dual forms, polygel brush with spatula, nail clips, and alcohol wipes. It comes nicely packaged in a lovely black box with cutouts to hold everything in place.<br />At minimum, you\u00a0will need to supply your nail prep\u00a0and finishing tools and liquids, such as: cuticle pusher and possibly nippers, a buffer, and nail dehydrator/alcohol, but these are things you will want to keep in good supply, anyways.<br />This\u00a0polygel is so easy to work with. It is not too hard nor too soft. It's very easily workable with the provided slip solution. Even a beginner will have no trouble using it. Just remember, that if your surrounding temperature gets too cold or too hot, it affects the viscosity of the polygel, so work in a room that feels nice.<br />I did two nail swatches; one solid glitter and the other a French manicure with a shimmery twist. As I said, the polygel applied so easily, it also cured as expected without any problems, and the end results turned out beautiful.<br />I have to say that when I received my Belle polygel kit, there was a small\u00a0issue with my order. I contacted their customer service and was met with such kindness and prompt service. They answered all my questions very quickly and respectfully. They're promptness in solving my\u00a0problem, and their patience in dealing with my questions, shows me that they really care about their customers. Knowing that they were not privy to my customer status lets me know that they will treat all customers the same.<br />The colors are all so beautiful, and the glitters really make a statement. This set would make a great addition to anyone's collection and would also make a wonderful gift. Knowing this polygel kit is also backed by Belle, a wonderful company who really values their customers, makes a great product even better. I would most definitely recommend it!", "label": 1}

I use Retin-A, so anything really harsh or very exfoliating is too much. The first one made my skin very red, swollen, and angry looking.

I am 50 years old, but I've been using Retin-A for several years now. I've had a mostly natural skin care routine, other than the Retin-A, but recently decided to try a few of the K-beauty products out.

With each use, it just gets better and better.<br />A little definitely goes a long way. Its texture is slimy, but I've found that I only need a very small amount to cover my face, and it massages in so easily.

{"text": "I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me\u00a0to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great\u00a0while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces,\u00a0put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br />I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These\u00a0are definitely on my must-have list. Highly recommend!", "label": 1}

The top coat brush was also drying out.<br />Luckily a different brand sends several brushes along with their sets, and they actually fit these bottles. It would have been nice if this company had sent along extra brushes. A brush cleaner would have been nice, also. If I didn't have extra brushes, I would just be out of luck.<br />I've used so many dip liquids and have done so many dip nail sets, and this is the first time I've ever had a brush dry out.

{"text": "After going over the ingredients in these products, the only two I would feel even remotely safe using would be this shampoo and conditioner. As a hair stylist, you do not want to use a product that contains formaldehyde and apply heat to it. You certainly do not want to use it every 6 weeks, as it's harmful to your health. It can cause breathing issues among other things. It's very hard to believe that I even saw actual formaldehyde on the back of this product, and so high up in the ingredients list.<br />Even hair stylist must wear protective gear, such as gloves, aprons, masks, and be trained how to safely work with this hazardous chemical. Salons must have adequate ventilation and follow strict protocols regarding blow dryer temperatures and monitor formaldehyde levels at all times when they provide Keratin Treatments containing formaldehyde because of the immediate and long term health dangers.This is something you cannot possibly do at home.<br />Also, the pretreatment that you add to the shampoo is extremely strong and stripping to your hair. When they say add just a little, no one knows what that means. That particular product, or the two main ingredients, should only be a small percentage of the product you're adding it to. I don't think you can mix this properly at home without causing damage to your hair and/or your skin.<br />I \"might\" use the shampoo and conditioner, but I will not touch the pre-treatment nor will I touch the DIY home keratin treatment. Over the course of a few treatments, I can see this product going really awry for some people. They will end up with damaged hair and possibly other problems. It is not safe.

{"text": "The name of these masks really throws you off. It makes you think they are supposed to be used with an LED light, but they are not. Upon opening one of the mask packages, I wasn't expecting a gooey, in between a cream and lotion, to start leaking out. It's not like a Serum at all.<br />The mask itself is quite thin, but it's not at all easy to tear. I read that one reviewer commented that it rips easily. On the contrary, it's quite difficult to even tear it. I actually had to use scissors to cut it for a use that I will explain later. It is a good size, covering all areas quite well. The cutouts for the eyes are quite small, which I like because it really gets to the under-eye area without it getting into your eyes.<br />I left it on for 20 minutes, and then did as another reviewer did, and cut it up and put it on my neck & decollete for another 20 minutes, with the rest of the cream/lotion that was left in the package.<br />This mask is extremely moisturizing and did not sink into my skin completely afterwards. I had used Retin-A the night before, so my face was quite dry, and really needed moisture and nutrients. But, I think it is a little too oily for my skin. My skin was still so oily hours later that I had to blot it with a microfiber facial cloth. The next day my skin felt great, though, without any ill effects.<br />These are very moisturizing and emollient masks, and would be great for someone with extremely dry skin. For me, I think these will work well using them once a week or every other week, when my skin is at its driest. For five masks, I think the price point is just right. I would definitely recommend these. Especially for those with very dry skin.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is only my second time using a face mask, and this one was a much better experience than the last. I chose the morning to do the mask while I was having my morning coffee, checking the computer, and using my LED White light therapy lamp. The Mask itself is made of a very durable fabric like material that does not tear. The serum is nice and silky feeling without any scent, that I could tell. I appreciate that, as I have a sensitivity to certain smells.<br />For me, the mask was a little bit short on the forehead and not wide enough on the cheeks. I don't have a large face at all, and I had quite a bit of skin left to cover around the sides and top.<br />There's an ample amount of serum left in the package that I was able to keep re-wetting the mask with, as it seemed to dry fairly quickly. I also rubbed some on my neck and decollete. I left it on for about an hour, so that my skin could soak in as much as possible. I then used the mask to rub the rest on my neck, decollete, and the backs of my hands. I wanted to make use of every bit I could. I use Retin-A on my face, and had done a treatment the night before, so my skin really needed the hydration and nourishment. It looked and felt very hydrated and nourished afterwards.<br />The only thing I did not care for was that my skin was very sticky after removing the mask, and it stayed that way. I ended up having to take a damp cloth and blotting it off. After that, my face felt a bit greasy, and I had to keep blotting it until it was time for my bedtime skincare routine.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed using this mask and will be using it at least once a week. It is very hydrating and nourishing, I just wish it didn't leave the sticky and greasy feeling behind. Maybe, I left it on too long, as I do have combination normal to oily skin. Next time I will only leave it on for about 15 minutes, as I think that may work much better for me. I would definitely recommend this mask, but would also recommend starting with less time than I did if you have combination to oily skin.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This mirror really wants to be elegant looking. It has a pearlized finish with some elegant swirls at the top, but it really just looks like a plastic vanity mirror that should come with one of the Barbie mannequin heads that little girls put makeup on and do their hair.<br />The mirror has three light settings, bright white, really yellow, and I'm assuming a daylight, which is the only light I can somewhat see myself a little bit with it on. Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless. Each mirror, in and of itself, is nice and clear and seems great. One might think of recycling them, or a young girl may find better use of this vanity mirror as she's playing dress up, or learning to do makeup. For myself, because I cannot see into it with the lights on, as it's meant to be used, and I don't find it aesthetically pleasing to display, I will not be using it.", "label": 1}

I use these types of oils to make my own facial oil mix or to add to my moisturizer.<br />The thing I absolutely hate that companies do to try to sell their products is to say things that aren't true. The USDA does not certify oils - food, cosmetic, or otherwise. The fact that the bottle says this product is USDA certified on one side, and the other side says not intended for ingestion should speak volumes. The USDA certifies and regulates the welfare and production of food products; meaning products that you ingest. So, why on earth would they certify a product you cannot ingest? The bottle also makes outright claims of known cures from using these oils. There is no disclaimer on either bottle that states that these claims have not been approved or proven by the FDA, or whatever the disclaimer is that is mandatory. There are ingredients listed, one ingredient for each product, the oil, and that's it. Nothing tells how these oils were extracted. Therefore, we do not know if they are refined or unrefined. They probably don't know either. So you see, therein lies the lies and deception.<br />These oils would be much better if they weren't tied to lies. Because you know what they say about lies... if you tell one you have to tell more to keep up with the first one. Is what they say in the bottle really what's in the bottle? Are they pure oils or mixed with a lesser oil? Oils are greasy. If they are unrefined, why aren't they greasy? When you refine oils, you take away a lot of their natural properties and their nutritive value, is that why they aren't greasy? Because of the lies and lack of important information, I really don't know for sure what these oils are.<br />Because of the deceptive practices and claims made, I would not recommend these or any of their other oils.", "label": 0}

They are easy to fill from my large pump containers, which is a plus. My only issue is that mine are missing the clips that go on them.

As nice as it is, it didn't feel as if it was cleaning between my teeth very well. I felt it gave a nice surface clean, but the pressure of the water was not enough to force out any particles from in between my teeth.<br />The flosser is also extremely loud. I've had the one I'm using for quite a while, and though it makes some noise, it isn't loud enough to hear from a couple of rooms away with the door shut. This one was scary loud. I'm not sure if it may have a defect or not, so others may not have this problem.<br />For me, this flosser does not have enough power behind it, and it is just too loud for my liking.

It does take a bit longer. And, I love that the clear is clear. It's nice that you get some glitters, along with the poly gel, to experiment with a bit of nail art to see if you like doing your nails at home, before investing a lot of money in supplies. Overall, I think this is a good budget starter kit if one has a bit of patience. 4 stars \u2728", "label": 1}
{"text": "Wow! This set comes with so many different types of butterflies. I love how the butterfly stickers come in so many different colors that no matter what color polish should you choose to wear, there are so many butterflies that will go with it. Some of my favorite ones are the butterfly outlines that are shiny or holographic. Most of the color ones also shimmer, which is so beautiful.<br />I like that there are butterflies that are flying sideways and also complete butterflies. It gives nail art a lot more interest. Having the glitter butterflies is a bonus to play around with encapsulating. With this sticker and glitter kit, there are so many nail art designs you can create. I've done several, but my mind is filled with endless possibilities. Highly recommended! 5 stars \u2728", "label": 1}
{"text": "In this kit, you get a nice set to complete a French tip design. You get 30 ml of each color, which is a wonderful size. You also get a base and topcoat, an application tool, and a couple of glitters. This would make the perfect kit if it didn't have a few issues.<br />So far, I've only used the clear and white poly gels to create a French tip design. They are a bit tackier than I would like them to be, which makes them harder to work with. They also take quite a bit longer to fully cure under an LED UV light than most other poly gels. I did use tips and dual forms. When I remove the dual forms after curing them for 60 seconds on top and bottom, they were still tacky on top. I had to cure them for another 30 seconds. My nails only lasted a little over a week before starting to lift around the edges. This is hardly a long-lasting poly gel, in my opinion.<br />I'm a still licensed but retired nail technician, so I am very well aware and knowledgeable on how to prep nails properly. User error was not the problem. These gels would be good for practice, but if you are looking for a poly gel that will last for more than a week, you may want to look at another brand. 3.5 Stars \u2728", "label": 1}
{"text": "When I saw these I was so excited because they match most of my wardrobe. I'm always wearing my hair up and love wearing skinny hard headbands with ponytails to keep straggly hairs back. I thought this would be something new to try altogether.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this fabric is awful to wear in your hair. I am a seamstress and it is definitely synthetic and feels like it. It's slippery, hot, and doesn't' feel nice at all. The design seems like an afterthought, as it will not stay in place.<br /><br />So, I've had a big change of plans! I will be using these during my skincare routine and putting on my makeup. At least these headbands will get some use. I'm constantly losing the ones I have, so now I have plenty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3.5 stars for effort and couldn't bear to recommend them. Sorry.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This was my first experience with poly gel, and I can't say that it was an easy and straightforward one. I did do some research and watched several videos to learn the process before even venturing into trying my own. Boy,\u00a0I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into... This is nothing like my beloved Acrylics! But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro \"lift proof\" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br /><br />First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish.\u00a0<br /><br />It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes. But, in the end, I had a pretty nice looking poly gel nail for the first time ever.<br /><br />I appreciate that the kit comes with all the necessities, aside from the slip solution. It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail\u00a0form\u00a0attachment\u00a0things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel. You definitely get a lot for your money, and you will get a nice strong nail from this kit. I'm giving 4 stars \u2728 for the lack of information on the packaging and instructions on colors and curing times. But, I really do think I will like it much better once I get the hang of it.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This was my first magnetic eyeliner and eyelash kit. The eyeliner works great and the lashes adhere very well. The eyelashes themselves are beautiful and I love the lengths.\u00a0The liner is easy to put on and so are the lashes. And, they stay on very well, with one exception.<br /><br />The eyelashes are too wide for my eyes, and I need to cut the last magnet off for them to fit properly. But, when I do that the outer end flips up and makes the lashes look terrible. If I don't cut them, they stick into the inner corner of my eyes, causing major irritation and immediately flip up, also making them look terrible.\u00a0<br />I feel like they need one more magnet on the outer end,\u00a0close to the last magnet. Because, most people need to trim any and all eyelashes, in order to make them fit their eyes better. In every video I've ever watched with glue on lashes, the person always has to trim the eyelashes just a little bit shorter in width. Why didn't the manufacturers of these eyelashes think that it would not be the same for these lashes?<br /><br />I love the concept, and really wish that these worked for me, because I have very dry eyes and cannot wear eye makeup and mascara. They just need another magnet!", "label": 1}

It only takes one for each task. I haven't had any problems with them falling apart or being too thin for my needs. Using them for my purposes, the three pack has & will last me for a pretty long time.<br />It's nice to find the right size product for the right size need that I have.

{"text": "I'm really on a kick of trying the whole OZ line...and I am in love with all of it. In fact, I find a way to use every serum over two days. I use Retin A every other night and use the vitamin c serum after using it. The next night, I use the Vitamin c with AHA and the Hyaluronic acid serums along with this one. I do wait about 10-15 minuites between each. But, I use the eye gel every night. They all work so well together and my skin is looking and feeling so much better. My biggest problems are large pores and uneven texture. My texture has evened out so much and my pores are surprising me more each day. I'd say these serums really have made the biggest difference in my pores. I kept seeing my grandmother's nose in the mirror, and I'm only 46--I was really self conscious.

In terms of mascara, it's an excellent mascara. It does not make your lashes spidery or so, and make the lashes curly, defined and longer for a whole day.

It cuts the exact same way and pretty much identical to the original. Best part is that you get two of them.<br /><br />Generally, they recommend replacing the blades every three months, but I've used my original 1 for over six months and as long as you clean the blade, wash it, as well as removing any hairs the buildup inside the original machine or on the blade itself one should last you about the same. Considering you get two of them for $20 (at the time of writing this review 4/20/2022)  its a great deal.<br /><br />I was getting ready to shave my chest and armpits and waited for the blades to get delivered.

So I was looking for another fast alternative to get my hair back and out of my face that also wouldn't require an hour of brushing to undo.<br />These were cheap, and Amazon is always so great about returns, that I decided to give it ago.  I figured, at worse, at least it would be a simple-ish way to pull my hair back when I am working at the computer.  And they are.  20 seconds and my hair is back in a bun without the discomfort of lots of other hair styles.  I mean, they are actually surprisingly comfortable.<br />But what I did not expect is for them to hold so well!  I put my hair in a high bun yesterday then went for a run.  I had fully intended to take the bun out and put my hair in a braid, because there was no way this thing would hold through a run, but IT DID!  7 miles later, my bun was still secure and tight, but comfortable and looked as good (which honestly wasn't that good to begin with) as it did when I first put it up.  I could not believe it held through the entire run.<br />In all honesty, they are a bit fussy to use, and I have not perfected making it look like a perfect doughnut bun.  But I'm not looking for winning style awards.  I just wanted a simple way to get my hair up and back that would hold for a few hours.

In the few weeks we\u2019ve been using the serums, neither of us have noticed any dramatic changes as far as lash or brow growth, but I do think I\u2019m losing fewer lashes which is a definite plus. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure if any serum is going to provide dramatic results, but we\u2019ll continue for at least a few more weeks and see what happens while hoping for the best.Hopefully, I\u2019ll be back with exciting news!<br /><br />Update: After using this, as well as other, lash growth serums for several months, I have noticed a definite improvement in the length of my lashes. I have not noticed as significant an improvement in the thickness, or volume, of my lashes, however. I believe that these types of serums do help promote growth, and I haven't been able to detect much difference between brands except that a couple of them irritated my eyes. Therefore, my conclusion is that this is helpful and the real determination of what works best will be what's most comfortable for you to use, so read the ingredients and watch for any possible allergy triggers or irritants.", "label": 1}
{"text": "When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn\u2019t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product\u2026<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It\u2019s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading \u201cSkin Set Go.\u201d  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company\u2019s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company\u2019s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I\u2019d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It\u2019s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it\u2019s unique, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s memorable. However, there\u2019s a ton of plastic used that isn\u2019t necessary, and with the design, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you\u2019re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This is a thick, rich cream that, for me, has worked wonders on dry, scaly skin. My hands needed some serious help and after using this cream for just a few days, I have seen much improvement. My skin is much soft, the cracks are disappearing, and they feel moisturized. The cream is thick, a little goes a long way, and I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best to really rub it in, not list skim it over the skin and leave it. I have also been using the cream on a particularly itchy patch of skin on my back, again, with excellent results.<br />There is no scent.<br />The cream is made from several natural ingredients, most notably Manuka honey from New Zealand, something new to me, but that has been used for centuries in New Zealand. I\u2019m glad it made its way to me in the USA!", "label": 1}
{"text": "This pillow is soft and comfy and makes for a relaxing bath. I love the soft fabric that covers the pillow, such an improvement over the plastic pillow I had been using. With six suction cups, it stays in place in my free-standing tub, and it\u2019s just the right size to cradle my head and also cushion my upper back. There is an attached hook to hang the pillow to dry when done bathing. Included with the pillow are a tool to loosen the suction cups from the tub, a storage bag, and a bag of rose petals for your first bath with the new pillow. A very nice pillow!", "label": 1}
{"text": "I like the silicone brush, it\u2019s soft and scrubs without scratching.  I wish it comes off, was kinda weird holding the whole bottle to scrub my face.<br />The cleanser looks and smells like unscented liquid soap.  It is like cleaning my face with foaming hand soap. It left it squeaky clean, which is nice. Takes away all the excess oil and grime and makeup.  My skin felt tight afterwards.<br />I don\u2019t know about the hydrating part as I always follow washing my face with aloe Vera gel. I have oily, sensitive skin and this didn\u2019t make me breakout.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Smells very mildly of ginger, I smell soap more than anything.  I followed directions and leave it on for 10 minutes before I step in the shower.  The way I use it is to leave it on the sink counter.  I lather it on specific areas and leave it on while I brush my teeth and do other morning routines.  It feels like a clean bar of soap.  After a week, no noticeable slimming, but those areas feel clean and less bloated.", "label": 1}

It peeled off like charred paper stuck to my skin.  My face felt very clean and smooth, though it didn't remove all the blackheads after one use.  The aloe gel felt refreshing on my skin.<br />Overall, a nice kit for facial cleansing.", "label": 1}

I tried a few that are close to my eyebrow shape and thickness (or thinness), but my eyebrows are a little too weird and short.<br />It took quite a bit of effort to transfer the color from the tube to my brows/skin.  The end result is okay.<br />It comes with a double ended brush to help with applying and fixing the color and shape, so that helps.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I don't think there are any creams that would make eyebags disappear.  I just look for ones that would reduce the feeling of puffiness.  For that, I'd give this 5 stars.

It also doesn't give me eye crusts.  There is no smell.  It doesn't have any bad interaction with my makeup either.", "label": 1}

Nothing was labeled,  the oil based makeups melted in the package,  the temporary tattoos didn't transfer cleanly,  the stencils were just stickers that didn't stay in place,  and in all,  this product was very disappointing. The only two upsides were the brushes included that were of good quality and the glitter gels that, while covering very thinly, shimmered nicely.  Just don't expect to apply thickly because it just won't happen.  I'd skip this kit.", "label": 0}
{"text": "These khaki brown neutral shadows are a good addition to my makeup palette. My favorite feature of this 6 piece cream eye shadow is that it stays put even when I am sweating. Instead of streaking down my cheeks or blotching in the creases of my eyelids, it really stays on where it is supposed to, especially if I use an eyeshadow primer. The colors are lovely, neutral hues that most people will find complementary to  their skin tone. I have a couple of their eye shadow sets, but this is the one that gets used the most.<br /><br />The pink set is softly feminine with lighter colors to accent daywear. They are perfect for cooler skin tones or as highlights on the eye for warmer tones.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The mask goes on easily with the spatula and dries with a more matte finish to show when it is ready. I could feel it tightening as it dried. It peels off easily where enough is applied, but tends to leave behind the edges, like most of these types of masks do. I like the serum that comes after. I used the mask after taking a hot bath and washing with my regular cleanser to help open the pores, soften any blackheads, and loosen the dead skin. It works well, drying in about 20 minutes. It left my skin feeling soft. I then finished with the serum and enjoyed the selfcare it promotes. A nice addition to my routine.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I used this immediately after showering, two pumps, as stated on the box. Which happens to be in Japanese, so I've added translations for anyone interested.

It's very lightweight, no artificial scent, and soaks right in.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Oh my GAWWWD! This thing is amazing! This will be a lengthy review, but if you are like me, I hope you'll enjoy the very detailed essay I am about to write for the 2nd time because my original review closed out of the page :(<br /><br />I will preface this by letting you know I have coarse, curly hair. \"bUt hEaThEr, wHat nUmBer aNd pOroSitY aRe YoU?\".<br />I am 3a-c and high porosity. Now, it is storytime LOL, so grab a snack or an adult bev.<br /><br />Let me tell you about the root, no pun intended, of a good portion of my self esteem issues LOL. When I was a kid, I was teased relentlessly about my hair. Ah yes, even Rave/LA Looks gel, with a spritz of White Rain hairspray couldn't tame this! Kids are mean. I ran cross country all through high school, and with many mornings having only an hour to get ready after running until my bunions ached (what the heck heather, TMI!), I eventually learned the only way to keep these people from throwing tiny paper balls in my hair or touching it, was to throw it in a bun. Containment, if you will. That thing was so tight I could hardly think straight. Does that explain my grades lol? So, my hair means a lot to me, y'all!<br /><br />Moving onto the stuff you really want to know, the magical brush I'm in love with\ud83d\udc96<br /><br />This brush has what I assume are nylon bristles. The only suggestion I have is to replace them with boar bristles, but it isn't a deal breaker. A few, and I mean 2 or 3, of those bristles came out when I was examining this baby before using it. It has pins and bristles all the way around and up and down. They don't tug at the hair or stretch it to damage or snap damp hair. I did brush my hair out with a wet brush before using, though.<br /><br />The brush is so lightweight, I didn't think it was going to do much lol. Thank you to the manufacturer for making it so lightweight! It was such a breeze to brush the sections of hair. My wrists were happy :)<br /><br />The brush does get hot, but not too hot! I accidentally touched the metal part a few times and I still have all my fingers! Yeehaw! There is a little knob that sticks out, to grasp onto as you roll the brush through your hair. You could probably use a straightening glove too! I have never used a Revlon brush, nor touched one irl. So, take that for what it is, but I've watched A LOT of videos on YouTube with that specific brush. I believe the Revlon is heavier and hotter than this brush. I have heard of some gals smelling burning. I did not experience that. I did use a heat protectant (up to 450\u00b0) along with a leave in cream. By the way, there is an air (I assume cool) setting, which is amazing as it is actually regar air! Not semi warm air like some dryers I've used in the past. The low setting is low and the high is faster and hotter. They light up so you know what is what! Love it.<br /><br />Please don't expect this to smooth it out like a flat iron would. This provides the perfect base though, to smooth with a flat iron quickly. It took me from start to finish about 50 mins. Some of that time was spent sectioning and spraying the hair with protectant, as well as doing some house stuff. Realistically it maybe took 40 mins. I did wait after my wash and condition, to let the hair dry a little bit. To about 85%. I even spritzed dry sections with water as needed, so my brush could glide through. I've only used this 2x. Once on wet hair and once for a touch up. I'm hoping to be as good as Julissa Guillen on YouTube, as I use this more :) maybe I'll be faster and it'll be smoother too!<br /><br />I used this before bedtime, so I don't have a day of wear pics available for you.<br /><br />But, the second pic shows my hair wet, unbrushed.<br /><br />The third pic is right after finishing! AMAZING! I was literally in awe! Couldn't believe it. Even after cosmetology school, I couldn't master a blowout on myself *cries*<br /><br />The fourth pic is the next morning. Slept on a regular cotton pillowcase (I should get a satin one from Amazon lol). I left it down while I slept btw.<br /><br />The last pic is after a go through with the flat iron. I didn't have to section my hair for once to flat iron my hair! I just ran it through with some more heat protectant as well, a must have :D<br /><br />Besides the boar bristle suggestion, I did notice the words on the dryer are already faded. It doesn't affect the dryer, so I really don't care lol. The other thing was the twisty thing to turn the dryer on, doesn't line up directly with the lights and words (OFF, AIR, LOW, HIGH). Again, I don't care but everyone different, so I wanted to let you beautiful awesome people know!<br /><br />Overall, I am so impressed and so upset at myself for not getting one of these sooner. Can't beat the value and it comes with a warranty. Thank you HAUSBELL, I LOVE YOU!\u2763\ud83d\udc9e\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc87\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "label": 1}

Not me!<br /><br />It works for other types of hair, though. I was able to wax my legs. The temperature control is reassuring (no worries about burns), and the roll on applicator is way less messy than sticks in a pot. It comes with plenty of supplies, too.

They are small (1 cm diameter) so the coverage is limited, but they adhere well.<br /><br />There are a couple of cons with these that lower my score:<br /><br />> They are harder to peel off the backing than others, and it's easy to fold over the edge of the patch when removing it, making it less effective. Other brands I've used have slits in the backing material, making it much easier to dispense a patch without damaging it.<br /><br />> The packaging is very wasteful. Each sheet of 20 comes in its own box. You could easily fit several sheets into one box. Either the box should be made much smaller or each box should hold multiple sheets.

Once it's applied there's no scent that I can detect, which is a major plus.<br /><br />It's a soft cream that's easy to dispense and spread. That's also a plus since other intensive moisturizing creams I've tried tend to be more solid and harder to use.

It's not a significant problem for elbows, knees, feet, etc., but is a issue when using it on my hands.

The packet is soft, which means it's not ideal for dispensing one wipe at a time without some measure of struggle. There's an adhesive flap to cover the opening, but again, as with pretty much any packet with this design, the flap doesn't do nearly as good of a job as a hard plastic cover.<br /><br />The wipe material is soft but pretty durable. It's designed to be a \"prep\" before using a stick-on breathing strip on your nose. As such, it doesn't do all that good of a job. While it does contain witch hazel, there's too little of it for the wipe to perform well. Witch hazel is the last ingredient (after water, glycerin, and aloe). Witch hazel is a great prep for any adhesive to ensure a good skin bond. Using these wipes is really no better for that task than plain water.<br /><br />While it is a comfortable wipe to use for general face and hand cleaning, given the price and the lack of unique benefits re: better adhesion, I see this as a 3 star (average) product at best.

It cleans very well but doesn't leave my face dry. I've had zero irritation from it even though it's a good, deep cleaner.<br /><br />The scent is very enjoyable. It's a light floral/fruity scent that is unique. It is not overpowering, and doesn't linger after rinsing.<br /><br />The tube comes nicely packaged for protection during transit. It's in a reinforced box cardboard box that is shrink wrapped. Even if it's sent in a padded envelope there's very little risk of the tube leaking in transit.<br /><br />No complaints at all.

My face feels tight after using it but in a good way -- a clean tightness rather than a dried out tightness.<br /><br />The scent is excellent. It's a woodsy type of scent that is different and very enjoyable. The scent does not linger after use (which is a shame since it is such a nice smell).<br /><br />It's pricey per ounce, but considering how little is needed for good results, the cost per use is not bad at all.

The scent is quite nice, with the eucalyptus coming through the most. It's a medium/mild level of scent that is noticeable without being overwhelming. The scent does not linger after rinsing. The soap itself is black due to the inclusion of charcoal.<br /><br />The dispensing tube is well done, with a screw base that pushes up the soap easily and evenly. It also has a screw top cover, which is a nice touch for keeping the lid affixed if you take this while traveling or use it in a gym bag.<br /><br />It's an unusual but enjoyable twist on face soap.

The standard clipper is very nice -- solid, sharp, and well up to the task of handling fingernails and lighter toenails. The various tools are also of decent quality.<br /><br />What's not so good is the toenail clippers. It has a rather lightweight feel to it compared with other clippers I've used. The short handles make it less comfortable to use than other clippers. More importantly, the spring mechanism failed within the first couple of minutes of use. It uses two leaf style springs that push the jaws apart. The problem is with how they attach to the handle. There are two little prongs for each spring that fit into two little holes in the handle. For mine, the pins are too short to make a solid connection, so one falls (or rather, jumps) out no matter how many times I've tried to seat it properly into the handle (see photo).  It can be used without the spring, but it's quite cumbersome to do so. Given the importance of the toenail clipper to the overall usefulness of the kit, I see this as a 2 star product.<br /><br />If the springs were better it would be 4 stars since, even when properly functioning, the clippers are not as easy to use as others, but warrant 4 stars given the low cost compared with better quality clippers.", "label": 0}

It is a low-lather, but still effective cleaner, but I didn\u2019t experience any difference with this compared with other 2% salicylic cleaners that cost far less. It\u2019s a fine cleaner, but way overpriced for such a tiny (0.51 oz) container.<br /><br />The repairing night cream is a combination of retinol (0.05%), niacinamide (3%), and hyaluronic acid (2%). All are proven performers, but again, it\u2019s quite overpriced considering how low of a percentage of retinol is in the formulation. It does a decent job of moisturizing and did not cause any skin irritation. I am a fan of retinol, but the concentration in this cream (0.05%) is well below what I usually use (either 0.1% or 0.5%).<br /><br />While this product combo is on the right track, the value is just not there considering the amount in the container (one-half an ounce for each). While I would certainly recommend a salicylic acid wash and a retinol-based cream, there are many other options that provide these options at a far lower cost.

The included caps (2 were provided) are of excellent quality, with polycone inserts to maintain an air-tight, leak proof seal. The included sprayers (2 were provided) are functional, but rather cheap in terms of build quality, especially the trigger. It also comes with a tiny little funnel that is way undersized and pretty useless given the bottle volume, and a few black labels (which require a white pen, which is NOT included).<br /><br />Each bottle comes in a bubble pack sleeve, but the box itself is rather thin with limited protection. These are a notch below other bottles I've received when it comes to manufacturer-provided protective packing. Still, the bottles did not break or chip in transit.<br /><br />The bottles needed a good wash before use since the outside had some type of greasy-feeling film. I would have washed them regardless of their condition, but these definitely needed a good washing before use.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration I'll rate these as 4 stars. Well worth considering if you need a more colorful option than amber and don't expect to be using the sprayer much (or at all).", "label": 1}

Normally I prefer unscented (or something that just smells soapy) but this light scent is quite enjoyable. It's a thick cream that resembles a moisturizer more so than a soap.<br /><br />There's virtually no lather to it. It foams up a bit, but very lightly. It's a very gentle soap but, for me, it's a bit too gentle in that I don't have a clean feeling after using it. My face feels more like I've applied a moisturizer. That's not a bad thing, especially in the dry winter months, but I want to have a clean-feeling face after using a face soap, and I don't get it from this.<br /><br />Balancing the positive and negative features puts my rating at three stars (average).

That's especially welcome to find out given the price for a pretty small bottle.  It lathers up well and does a good job of cleaning without leaving my skin overly dry. It is a bit more intensive than other face soaps, so my face does feel a little 'tight' after using it. However, it's not excessive, and well worth it given how well this soap cleans if you have an oily complexation. The charcoal makes the soap dark, but it's not as jet-black as other charcoal soaps I've used. It's more of a deep gray.<br /><br />The scent is also quite nice. It's a medium/light intensity and has sort of an after-shave smell to it. The scent does not linger much at all after rinsing. While I tend to prefer unscented soaps, this scent is pleasant and enjoyable.<br /><br />The only con is the bottle. Getting the pump nozzle to pop up was a chore since the retaining ring the pump head screws into also rotates, making it a struggle to get the nozzle to pop up. I eventually got it working, but have noticed that the pump leaks at the stem. It's a small leak, but it adds up over a few days to make a mess on the bottle and waste soap.

The bottles are made of thin plastic that look and feel cheap. The trigger action on the sprayers is not smooth or reliable.

It's softer than the standard but firmer than the Ultra Soft.<br /><br />On the downside, it does not fit as well as the authentic Oral-B brushes. It's a little bit loose, which causes it to be noisier in operation than an authentic brush. It still works fine and stays on firm enough so there's no danger of it coming off in use, but there's enough play in the fit that it's more buzzy than an authentic.<br /><br />Even with the fit issue, this is a decent alternative to the Oral-B brand brushes and a solid 4-star brush.", "label": 1}

It is pretty grippy even with wet hands. It does not, however, feel as comfortable to hold as the more sculpted models such as most of the Panasonic shavers and some Braun shavers.<br /><br />The shave quality of this model is identical to that of the LifeProof: very Remington in how it feels (close, but rather aggressive). Performance is best on the easy spots (cheek) but not as good on the more trickier spots (neck and jawline). The flex head helps with dealing with face contours but it lacks enough travel to do an excellent quality job.<br /><br />The aggressiveness of the shave is dialed down when using it wet. It needs a very, very thin layer of shave cream (the gel style creams work well) or the head gets bogged down.<br /><br />Love the trimmer! The positioning could be improved to make it easier to use, but it cuts very cleanly on sideburns and \u2018shash trimming.<br /><br />The controls are clean, easy to read and tell you all you need to know (charge and battery status).<br /><br />I like the feel of this better than the Wahl LifeProof, but the shave quality keeps this at the same rating (average, which is 3 stars).

{"text": "This is a nice improvement to the Sonicare line of brushes. It appears to be their response to the Oral-B Floss Action line of brushes that have a \"paddle\" to help get between teeth. This accomplishes that goal with an plastic insert in the middle that helps direct the toothpaste between your teeth.<br /><br />I use both the Sonicare (Healthy White) and the Oral B 5000. Both have their pluses and minuses, so switching between the two gives me the best of both worlds.<br /><br />The Oral-B arrangement of paddles does a better job in getting at the gum line without discomfort. The Sonicare Hydroclean's bristles are stiffer and I find that they irritate my gums when used several times in a row.<br /><br />But, the Sonicare does a better job in cleaning stains between teeth. I'm a tea drinker and getting the stains out between my front teeth has always been a chore. The Hydroclean works very well - noticeable improvement over the Sonicare ProResults and the Oral-B.<br /><br />These only come in the standard size. The ProResults has a smaller version that is great for getting at the tight spots. But, I assume that a smaller version of this would not function well since the plastic insert would have to be very small.<br /><br />If you're a ProResults user these are well worth trying out.

I will probably never wear it out of the house. It looks awful with my red hair and I can't think of many outfits it would match either. That's why the set loses a star for me. The brownish one is lighter than pictured, too.", "label": 1}

I like that one serving delivers 10 mg of collagen but it's only one type - bovine collagen.  I think it's kind of pricey coming in at $34.95 (as of this review) since I've reviewed collagen powders that contains several types of collagen and were more than 9.3 oz for as much or even less money.  Also, you won't see any results in 2 weeks so don't let those reviews get you all excited.  I've been consuming collagen on a daily basis for about a year and am now just beginning to see some positive changes in my skin and nails.  I'm 63 and realize all the collagen supplements in the world won't make me look 40 again but I have seen some improvements in less crinkly skin on my arms and some fine lines around my eyes looking much smoother.  Collagen is not the fountain of youth but it does help if you are patient and consistent.", "label": 1}

However, these headbands (2 in a pack) are holding my hair out of my face just fine, and they don't get my head sore after wearing one for several hours.  They are made out of breakable plastic so I have to be a little careful with them, but they are very pretty in their unusual colorful design.  They have tiny little teeth in some spots to  grab hair and that makes the headbands very stable.  I think these are really good and am glad I finally decided to select them for review.", "label": 1}

These are the kind that allow you to try make lines that look like hairs though I have never been really all that good at doing that.  This is the first gray color eye brow pencil I've used and I like it pretty well.  The gray color is medium - not dark or light, but right there in the middle.  I use a very light touch and short strokes to get the color where I want it.  I have scant eye brow hairs and have to fill in to make it look like I have full eyebrows.  I like how this did, it seems to be waterproof and I really need waterproof because I play a lot of tennis and sweat a lot on the court under the hot sun in the Deep South.  I sweated a lot at practice last night and when I woke up this morning my eyebrows were still mostly there.  I can't complain about that.", "label": 1}

It won't stop sweating, but it will keep the smelly bacteria from breeding for a while so you don't stink.  I could feel the slight graininess of the cornstarch and arrowroot powder which let me know it was good quality.  I really like this and feel it is every bit as good as my own homemade deodorant.", "label": 1}
{"text": "These headbands are made out of strong metal and are well painted.  I like them but find that the tips are a little irritating - need more rubber on the them.  The wavy part sort of grabs my hair in a comb-backed way, but not all of it so I have to decide it I want my front hair loose or try to get the waves to comb more of it back.  These are very well made and should last a long time.  I haven't tried wearing more than one at a time but that might be a good idea.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I love bamboo brushes with bamboo bristles.  They feel so good on my scalp - like a scalp massage when I brush my hair with them.  This brush is really good, though I would have liked for the bristles pegs to be a little longer.  I find I have to push the brush down harder to get to my scalp.  I have another bamboo brush with longer bristles that I like best but this one is still a very good brush especially if you have short hair.

I make handmade soaps and I like to make BLACK soaps because they are so cool looking and clean the skin so well.  I used some of this in some soap and it worked great!

I think that's kind of expensive because though it's a good moisturizer, it's not a great moisturizer.  I can put it on my face, arms and hands and it feels good, but my skin is not as moisturized as some other lotions and creams that I've used.  I like the shape of the bottle because I can keep it in the slot in my car door and use it as needed.  But, I wouldn't be real thrilled if I paid nearly $26.00 for a 6.8 fl. oz bottle of this lotion and only got an average level of moisturization.", "label": 1}

I'm nearly 62 and my facial skin is sagging - the reason for me selecting these face lift tapes when they appeared on my list of items I could review.  Your skin must be clean, dry and free of any moisturizers.  They stick well to my skin and definitely pulls it up some.  However, the skin that's pulled up gets crinkled up and if your hair doesn't cover it, the crinkles will show.  The tapes are really hard to see once applied, and easy to apply once you get the hang of it.  I blew through at least 10 just trying to figure it out but you get 40 in a box.  Again, these do work, and help eliminate some drooping skin, but they aren't a really good solution, imho.", "label": 1}

That said, I only had my toes painted so it was not really possible for me to stick my toes in the jar and rotate them so I took the sponge out, gave it a squeeze to get to the excess nail polish remover off and went to work with on my toes.  It was very easy and very fast.  This nail polish remover is at least 3x better than what I have in bottles underneath my bathroom sink.  I think as the nail polish remover is used up and/or evaporates I will refill it with more nail polish remover.  The pink sponge was soft, yet still rough enough to get the old nail polish off.  At first I was thinking this thing was going to be a bust, but it has turned out to be extremely useful.", "label": 1}

They are so close to being the same size to fit, but the post on this toothbrush is too big for my replacement Phillips heads to fit.  So, replacement heads will have to be ordered specially and sometimes finding non-brand sonic toothbrush heads can be hard.  I have another sonic toothbrush that I love, but can't find any replacement toothbrush heads for it.

I used (carefully!) one of these small razors to try shaving just a small area of my face and it really did remove all the peach fuzz.  I can't say that they are any better than a ladies electric facial shaver I've been using, but these would be a lot easier to carry in my purse just in case I needed to use one.

Secure import of financials was a relief, and he was set up in about an hour or two and learning his way around the program with relative ease. He also has an assistant that he was able to easily add to the payroll and able to do so without the free support!<br /><br />Considering the list price on this new 2019 edition of Quickbooks is close to $500, the current offering is a steal and I recommend jumping on it before the price goes up again, as these sorts of offerings tend to fluctuate. QuickBooks is the most popular and affordable software compared to others on the market, and you do get what you pay for, so the value here is terrific too. I just began using the regular 2019 since I am on a smaller scale and this version is new to him, so I can't comment on the issues others are having.

The angled main clipper has a non-adjustable internal tension spring and a coated ergonomic shaped hand grip, while the other clipper has a coated non-ergonomic shaped grip.<br /><br />When trying to cut through tough thick nails you need a sure grip. Unfortunately, the grip coating material used on these clippers is hard and not padded, therefore failing to provide cushioning to users with arthritis or to provide a non-slip grip.<br /><br />I tried these clippers on my father's thick toenails, and they do cut, but not as sharply or precisely as the professional grade clippers I usually use on his nails.  Instead of one clean cut, it took several clips to get through his tough nails with these and because of that the finish was jagged and needed filing to smooth out.<br /><br />Though I wouldn't recommend this set for seniors, I do think the curved shape of the larger clipper is a nice touch though, so they're useful enough for regular nails and handy to pack if you're planning a trip.", "label": 1}

It hydrates without causing any redness, irritation or sensitivity.<br /><br />After the essence, I use the Itfer Emulsion.  The Emulsion has a light citrus scent and shares the light gel texture.

Enough Project is a new \"accessible\" and less expensive line that uses clean beauty ingredients.<br /><br />The peeling pack goes on easily and crumbles as you rub it on your face.  It exfoliates gently using plant extracts.  I have combination sensitive skin and my skin is adjusting to the seasons changing.

I have combination sensitive skin and need anti-aging products.  I found that this worked very well for me.  There is a light fruity scent but the lotion doesn't feel sticky or oily and is quickly absorbed into the skin. It looks matte but hydrates well and left my skin feeling very soft.  The lotion strengthens the skin barrier but doesn't have the slightly oily feel of many products that have the same purpose.  I also like that the lotion helps to increase collagen -- at my age this makes a difference.", "label": 1}

It does not use parabens - the product list shows the harsh ingredients that the sunscreen does not contain.  Aside from SPF, the sunblock also has moisturizing ingredients.  It is easy to use this everyday without causing a breakout or irritation of the skin.", "label": 1}

I rubbed it further into my skin to help it cleanse deeply. The cleansing balm didn't feel greasy or sticky.  I  left it on for a few minutes and rinsed. My skin felt clean and very soft.  It caused no irritation or sensitivity.", "label": 1}

I have oily skin in parts (T zone) and sensitive skin.<br /><br />This Luminous Face Oil combines several high quality antioxidants to help moisten and brighten the skin.  I found the face oil was not quickly absorbed into the skin.  I would prefer to use this at night because of the time it takes for the oil to be absorbed.  I did wake up with well hydrated skin. Considering the high cost of this face oil, I had expected it to standout. I may have to use it for an extended time before I feel or see results.<br /><br />I did not experience any redness, irritation or sensitivity.", "label": 1}

Resveratrol comes from grapes and has strong antioxidants.  This Essential Lipid Power Infusion also contains argan oil, rose hip oil, and a mix of extracts.<br /><br />I found this Essential Lipid Power Infusion to stay on my skin for a relatively long time.

The sunblock is thicker than usual but effective. It has a great smell and not greasy.  One application lasts reasonably long even when I exercise.

{"text": "These are SUPER sharp.  I have used this kind of clippers for over a decade.  When I first opened these, I felt like they were so sharp that I could do some serious damage.  Either I'm used to them now, or they have dulled just a tiny bit, but they are wonderful.  TEN TIMES better than anything I have ever bought from a store.  I have really bad ingrown toenails in one of my big toes, but I have removed both of them with these.  What relief!!  Be sure to keep the little plastic tip-protector that comes with it.  It protects the tip of the blades when they are stuck in a drawer.  It also prevents you from getting poked with it accidentally.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I have about 10 razors. I have been in search of better and better shaves. My Feather AS-D2 is awesome and smooth but perhaps a bit too mild. I fine even the Merkur 34C a little too aggressive for my skin. The Merkur Futur is horrible for me and is a paperweight for anyone who prefers mild razors. The iKon B1 slant is a perfect balance. Not too aggressive, and with a light touch it gave me a very smooth shave. I normally do 3 passes and then touch up areas that need it. I had 5 days growth when I shaved with this razor head today. I was amazed when I finished my first pass. It looked like I had done two passes with my other razors. I normally do with the grain, cross-grain, and then lightly against the grain.<br />With the B1 I did a with-the-grain pass and one very light across-the-grain pass and it looked like I was done shaving. I did a touch-up in one or two spots and I called it good. An against the grain pass would have left me absolutely BBS but that usually gives me ingrown hairs. Oh, by the way, no nicks, weepers, or irritation at all. The head is shaped very weird with the slant design but I was able to shave under my nostrils with ease; much better than most, actually! I really am impressed with this head.<br />I can't wait to do another shave tomorrow.<br />My shave:<br />iKon B1 head<br />iKon OSS handle from my 101<br />Persona Lab Blue blade (2nd shave on the blade)<br />Stirling Soap Co.

{"text": "This cream product is so thin and virtually weightless on the skin, and unlike many more organic oil based cream blushes, this blush is not tacky or oily to touch. I find the ideal way to apply this blush is by dipping your beauty blender into the pan. My personal favorite color is the lilac, as it's a nice cool-toned muted baby pink color. I hope amazon never stops carrying this product. I will repurchase this forever. FYI, my skin type is usually sensitive and this has never broken me out.", "label": 1}

{"text": "I don't know why Made in France barrette fixings are so superior to anything made in the United States -- they certainly look the same and mechanically, they function the same, but for some reason, the French barrettes are just a whole lot better.  They don't pull or catch my hair, they don't stretch out of shape, they don't break and bend.  I know this is a lot of $$ to spend on a barrette when you can get one for a fraction of this price at your corner drug store, but these France Luxe barrettes are worth it.  This coral colored scallop design is beautiful, and the barrette hold a lot of hair.  This is definitely for thick hair.  France Luxe also makes boule style barrettes for fine hair -- so if you don't have a thick mop, I would check out the other France Luxe designs.  These are expensive for what they are, but they're beautiful and long-lasting.  And they work, always important in a barrette.  I can put this barrette in my hair and it stays put all day.", "label": 1}

{"text": "After trying out a Philips (Norelco) 7120 to see if I could escape the wet razor trap I was ready for the next step; that model worked fine, except that by design the battery doesn't last that long and I could seldom get an acceptable shave around the neck. The 1050x solves both problems, I can shave in less time (must be the blades it uses) and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).<br /><br />It comes with a travel \"sarcophagus\" (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done quickly and easily enough.<br /><br />The only negatives are that it's quite a bit noisier than the 7120, but then again that is quite quiet... I still cannot get the best shave over the area between my mouth and my chin... But then again we all different facial features... And it's pricey... I'm still kicking myself for not buying this when it came out as a special deal... But I needed it too much to wait for another one to show up.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Update 20/02/10<br /><br />After a year and a half of good service my HQ7140 would not start even with the cord plugged in, unless I left it connected for a couple of hours...Obviously not an option when you're trying to get to work. I was about to order another one, already cursing for having to go back to blades even if only temporarily; but before that I took it to a specialized shop; they opened it and showed me it was wet on the inside and told me the \"circuit\" was fried. I explained that I had followed the manual to the letter, cleaning the shaving heads and the hair chamber with hot running water. They suggested taking the shaving unit off when I rinse it, use only warm (not hot) water, and *not* cleaning the hair chamber with water... They essentially sold me a brand new Philips HQ7120 as a replacement to use with my existing shaving unit for a reasonable price; it looks exactly the same except it has a \"Low\" red light.<br /><br />The interesting bit is that I had gone to them about a month ago to buy a new shaving unit and they told me the HQ9 heads would work fine with these models, not just the HQ8; the HQ9 feel even better, so much so that I would definitely buy the 8xxx series which use the HQ9... It was only when the 7140 failed that I realized just how much I depend on it and how well it has worked out - my technique still needs to improve and shaving still seems to take too long but no going back to blades for me!<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />As a wet shaving refugee I didn't know what to expect; I was just tired of getting cuts everyday, and paying an exhuberant tax to the wet shaver companies; I didn't want to buy a top of the line model in case things didn't work out.<br /><br />This has been a very pleasant surprise, as I'm getting close shaves with less fuss and no irritation; I beginning to get the hang of this and even the neck area is doing well.<br /><br />The battery's first run lasted for 4 days, but I may be taking a lot longer than normal while I learn. The battery light starts blinking when it's fuly charged, by the way.<br /><br />I have the Philips branded verion of this and it still says Made in Holland...", "label": 1}

{"text": "Got this kit on sale for under $20, which is an absolute steal! I guess TOBS discontinued the scent, so the supplier was clearing out inventory.<br /><br />It's a cologne-type scent with a modern vibe. The shave cream performs like other TOBS shave creams, which is a good thing. Easy to build a lather, reasonably slick and protective. The cream is harder than other TOBS creams I've used, but that doesn't affect performance in the least.<br /><br />The kit also comes with a badger brush and a cologne. The brush is actually pretty good! It's black badger hair, so the bristles are relatively stiff/scritchy, but I prefer that. Had the typical badger funk for the first few shaves, but now it's neutral. No lost bristles yet, so it seems like a quality brush/knot.<br /><br />The cologne is also nice, a matching scent to the shave cream. I find that it lasts 2-3 hours on my skin. It's a good office/professional scent: pleasant, inoffensive. Probably not going to turn any heads.<br /><br />No matter how you slice it, $20 for this kit is a great value!", "label": 1}
